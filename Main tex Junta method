\begin{abstract}
    We present an introduction to the junta method, a far reaching application of the hypercontractivity property in the field of Boolean analysis, in order to prove stability results in extremal combinatorics through spectral analysis techniques, predominantly concerning the Fourier expansion of the characteristic functions of sets and set-systems.\\We first introduce a result of Friedgut, Kalai, and Noar \cite{friedgut2002boolean} which shows that Boolean functions whose Fourier expansion is concentrated on the first two levels is well approximated by a dictatorship function. We then use this to prove a corollary of the first author \cite{friedgut2008measure} showing maximal measure intersecting families are stable under the $p$-biased measure for $p \le \frac{1}{2}$.\\ We see that when the ground set of the combinatorial problem is changed \cite{ellis2012triangle} it can lead to dramatic changes in the spectral techniques required to solve similar extremal intersection problems concerning graphs.\\Finally we give a brief summary of a new junta approximation of Keevash, Lifshitz, Long, and Minzer \cite{keevash2024turan}, an application of their novel global hypercontractivity inequality, allowing for stability results concerning expanded forbidden hypergraphs.

\chapter{Introduction}
A core theme in extremal combinatorics is to find the size of a largest set system under some given combinatorial constraints. Classical examples of this include Mantel's theorem and Erd\H{o}s-Ko-Rado theorem. In solving such problems we may be able to infer the optimal size, as well as the optimal size inducing structure. Another question that one may ask is whether the structure is stable, that is to ask the following: \begin{large}
    \begin{center}
    \textit{``If a structure is close to having the optimal size, is said structure close to having the optimal size inducing structure?''}
\end{center} \end{large}
When dealing with such problems it is natural to consider the Boolean function representation of set systems, due to their discrete form, where for a set $A\subseteq [n]$, for $i \in [n]$ we have:\begin{equation*}
f_A(i)=
    \begin{cases}
        1 & \text{if } i \in A,\\
        0 & \text{otherwise.}
    \end{cases}
\end{equation*}\\
Hence the use of Boolean analysis becomes an attractive option for solving such problems. The two core aspects concerning Boolean analysis are the existence of the unique Fourier expansion, which represent Boolean functions via a unique multilinear polynomial, and the use of the classical hypercontractive inequality (independently obtained by Beckner \cite{beckner1975inequalities}, Bonami \cite{bonami1970etude}, and Gross \cite{gross1975logarithmic}) as well as other variants, which give a relationship between a Boolean function and it's output under perturbation.\\
In 2002 Friedgut, Kalai, and Naor \cite{friedgut2002boolean} published a paper showing, through the use of a hypercontractivity result, that Boolean functions whose Fourier expansion were concentrated on degrees less than or equal to $1$ were well approximated by a dictatorship function, a Boolean function whose output could be determined by the observation of at most $1$ input bit. Six years later in 2008 Friedgut would show using this result that under a $p$-biased measure with $p<1/2$, the maximal measure of an intersecting family on a ground set $[n]$ had a unique maximal structure, and held the stability property.\\
In 2012 Ellis, Filmus, and Friedgut \cite{ellis2012triangle} would solve a 14 year old unanswered question of Vera S\'{o}s, concerning the structure of a largest set of families of graphs which all pairwise intersected on a copy of $K_3$. Here they showed that the unique maximal structure was a triangle junta, and that this result was stable. In proving stability the use of a result of Kindler and Safra \cite{kindler2002noise} similar to Friedgut, Kalai, and Noar's was invoked.\\
Most recently Keevash, Lifshitz, Long, and Minzer derived their novel global hypercontractivity inequality \cite{keevash2024hypercontractivity}. This allowed for a new result concerning sharp thresholds which when combined with a powerful strategy for finding matchings in hypergraphs, under certain restrictive pseudorandomness conditions, allowed the proof of their refined junta approximation \cite{keevash2024turan}. This in turn allowed for the proof of two longstanding unproven Turán results concerning uniform expanded critical graphs of bounded degree and the Füredi–Jiang–Seiver conjecture, concerning expanded paths. \\
The main goal of this dissertation is to give an overview, as well as some examples, of the junta method for extremal combinatorics. Chapter 2 will give an introduction to the preliminary material we need from Boolean analysis. Chapter 3 is an overview of Friegut, Kalai, and Naor's paper, ``Boolean functions whose Fourier Transform is concentrated on the first two levels'' \cite{friedgut2002boolean}. Chapter 4 covers the stability result of a corollary of the main theorem of \cite{friedgut2008measure} on intersecting families. Chapter 5 gives a partial proof of the main result of \cite{ellis2012triangle} on $K_3$-intersecting families of graphs, as well as proving numerous unproven claims made in that paper. Chapter 6 gives exposition of the KLLM hypercontractivity result \cite{keevash2024hypercontractivity} and its applications. Chapter 7 concludes the dissertation and summarises what has been covered. \newpage


\chapter{Boolean analysis, the Fourier expansion and hypercontractivity}

A Boolean function is any function whose domain is the discrete hypercube $\{-1,1\}^n$. In this dissertation we will assume the codomain of such functions is $\mathbb{R}$, so that if $f$ is Boolean we have \[f:\{-1,1\}^n \rightarrow \mathbb{R}.\] It is common practice to use the discrete hypercube to represent many different discrete structures, such a set-systems in the analysis of combinatorics or logical statements in theoretical computer science. Hence the analysis of such functions becomes particularly useful when solving related issues.

\section{The Fourier expansion}

The field of Boolean analysis is centred around the analysis of the Fourier expansion of functions $f:\{-1,1\}^n \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ and the properties that entail. We begin by stating without proof that all Boolean functions of the form above can be represented as a unique multilinear polynomial. First we require the following definition: 

\begin{definition}[monomial corresponding to $S$]
    For a subset $S \subseteq [n]$ we write the monomial corresponding to $S$ as \[x^S = \prod_{i\in S}x_i,\]with $x^\emptyset=1$ by convention.
\end{definition}
We are now ready to state the fundamental theorem of the existence of the Fourier expansion.
\begin{theorem}[\cite{o2014analysis}, Theorem 1.1]
    Every function $f:\{-1,1\}^n \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ can be uniquely expressed as a multilinear polynomial, \[f(x) = \sum_{S\subseteq[n]}\widehat{f}(S)x^S. \label{Fourier Walsh}\]This expression is known as the Fourier expansion of $f$, and the real number $\widehat{f}(S)$ is known as the Fourier coefficient of $f$ on $S$. Collectively, the coefficients are called the Fourier spectrum of $f$.
\end{theorem}

Before proceeding we will give an example of this on a common function. We define the function $f=\text{max}_2$ to be the maximum function on 2 bits: \begin{align}
    \text{max}_2(+1,+1)=+1, \nonumber \\ \text{max}_2(-1,+1)=+1, \nonumber \\ \text{max}_2(+1,-1)=+1, \nonumber \\ \text{max}_2(-1,-1)=-1. \nonumber
\end{align}

Then observe that $\text{max}_2$ can be expressed as the unique multilinear polynomial, \begin{equation}{\label{max2_multilinear_polynomial}}
    \text{max}_2(x_1,x_2)=\frac{1}{2}+\frac{1}{2}x_1+\frac{1}{2}x_2-\frac{1}{2}x_1x_2.\end{equation} 
    
This is the Fourier expansion of $\text{max}_2$.\\
Later on we will be using junta type methods in order to solve extremal problems, hence we will need to define the degree of such Boolean functions. We have as follows:
\begin{definition}[real degree of $f$]

Let $f:\{-1,1\}^n \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ be nonzero. The (real) degree of $f$, written deg($f$), is defined to be the degree of its multilinear Fourier expansion. That is to say max\{$|S|:\widehat{f}(S)\neq0$\}.
    
\end{definition}

As we can see in Equation \ref{max2_multilinear_polynomial}, the degree of $f=\text{max}_2$ is $2$, since 
$\widehat{f}(\{1,2\}) = -\frac{1}{2}$.\\
We also have the Fourier-weight:

%This idea of stratifying our Fourier-Walsh expansion by grouping different subsets by cardinality induces our second definition which will be important later on when we introduce hypercontractivity.

\begin{definition}[Fourier-weight]
For $f:\{-1,1\}^n \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ and $0 \le k \le n$, the Fourier weight of $f$ at degree $k$ is 
\[W^k[f] = \sum_{\substack{S \subseteq [n] \\ |S|=k}}\widehat{f}(S)^2.\]
We define the Fourier weight of $f$ on a set $S \subseteq [n]$ to be the squared Fourier coefficient $\widehat{f}(S)^2$ 
    
\end{definition}

We will see in the next chapter that if the size of higher Fourier-weights can be bounded, say $\sum_{k > l}^nW^k[f]\le \epsilon$, then under the right conditions the Boolean function $f$ is similar in structure to a function $g$ of degree at most $l$.

\section{Hypercontractivity}
%We also define the general degree. For $\pi$ a probability distribution on $\Omega$, let $\pi^{\otimes n}$ denote the associated product probability distribution on $\Omega^n$.

%\begin{definition}[Degree of $f$]
%Let $f \in L^2(\Omega^n,\pi^{\otimes n})$ be nonzero. The degree of $f$, written \text{deg}($f$), is the smallest $k \in \mathbb{N}$ such that $f$ is a sum of $k$-juntas (functions depending on at most $k$ coordinates).
    
%\end{definition} 
One of the key areas of Boolean analysis revolves around the idea of hypercontractivity. In this chapter we will state and give a brief overview of the classical hypercontractivity theorem. Before doing so we present some useful definitions. For $1 \le q < \infty$, we define the $L_q$-norm of a function $f:\{0,1\}^n \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$\footnote{Throughout this paper we will switch back and forth between the domain of Boolean functions being $\{-1,1\}^n$ and $\{0,1\}^n$ when necessary. For the most part it does not particularly matter too much in any of the analysis.} as 
\[ ||f||_q=\sqrt[q]{\mathbb{E}[|f|^q]}.\]We also present the idea of $\rho$-correlated random vectors and the noise operator $T_\rho$. 

\begin{definition}[$\rho$-correlated random vectors]

For $-1 \le \rho \le 1$ we say that two vectors $x,y \in \{0,1\}^n$ are $\rho$-correlated if: 

\begin{enumerate}
  
    \item The marginal distributions of $x$ and $y$ are uniform.
    \item For all $i \in [n]$ $\mathbb{E}[x_iy_i]=\rho$.

\end{enumerate}

\end{definition}

We note that we can generate a pair of $\rho$-correlated random vectors as follows. First choose vectors $x$ and $z$ independently and uniformly at random from the set $\{0,1\}^n$ with each input equal to $1$ with probability $p$ and $0$ otherwise. Then generate a vector $y = \{y_1,y_2,\ldots,y_n\}$ by, for each $i \in [n]$, independently generating $y_i$ as:

\begin{equation}
y_i=
    \begin{cases}
        x_i & \text{with probability } \rho,\\
        z_i & \text{with probability } 1-\rho.
    \end{cases}
\end{equation}\\
We denote the above distribution by $\mathbf{y}\sim N_\rho(x)$.\\
Following on from this we define the noise operator $T_\rho$, first introduced by Bonami \cite{bonami1970etude} and later independently by Beckner \cite{beckner1975inequalities}.

\begin{definition}[noise operator]

For $\rho \in [-1,1]$, $p \in [0,1]$ and $f \in L^2(\{0,1\}^n,\mu_p)$ we define the noise operator $T_\rho$ as,
\[T_\rho(f)(x) = \mathbb{E}_{\mathbf{y}\sim N_\rho(x)}[f(\textbf{y})].\]Here we are concerned with Boolean functions which are $L^2$-integrable with respect to the $\mu_p$ measure. For a set $S \subseteq [n]$ we define $\mu_p(S)=p^{|S|}(1-p)^{n-|S|}$ and for a family of sets $\mathcal{F}$ we define $\mu_p(\mathcal{F})=\sum_{S \in \mathcal{F}}\mu_p(S)$.

\end{definition}

We are now ready to state the hypercontractivity theorem, proven by Bonami in 1970.

\begin{theorem}[\cite{o2014analysis}, The Hypercontractivity Theorem]
Let $f:\{-1,1\}^n \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ and let $1 \le r \le s \le \infty$. Then $||T_\rho f(x)||_s \le ||f||_r$ for $0 \le \rho \le \sqrt{\frac{r-1}{s-1}}$.
\end{theorem}

%local needs quotation marks around.
We note here that the Hypercontractivity theorem is similar to H\"{o}lder's inequality; $||f||_r \le ||f||_s$ whenever $r \le s$, except now we get an inequality in the other direction after applying noise to the input of $f$. Keevash, Lifshitz, Long, and Minzer \cite{keevash2024hypercontractivity} note that applications of the hypercontractivity theorem are somewhat limited when dealing with local functions. For example, in the uniform case with $p=\frac{1}{2}, r=2$ and $s=4$ we have \[||T_\rho f(x)||_4 \le ||f||_2\]for any $\rho \le \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}$. We will see later that we typically will use the hypercontractivity theorem for proving stability results concerning juntas, for example $f(x)=x_1$ (the dictator function). In \cite{keevash2024hypercontractivity} they note that by setting $p = o(1)$ and applying the general inequality to the dictator function, we have $||f||_2 = \sqrt{\mu_p(f)}=\sqrt{p}$ and $T_\rho f(x)=\mathbb{E}_{\mathbf{y}\sim N_\rho(x)}\mathbf{y_1}=\rho x_1+(1-\rho)p$, hence $||T_\rho f||_4 > \sqrt[4]{\mathbb{E}[\rho^4x_1^4]} = \rho p^{1/4}$. Therefore we need $\rho = O(p^{1/4})$ to obtain any hypercontractive inequality for general $f$ within the $p$-biased setting. This naturally brings us on to the concept of local and global functions. The dictator function can be described as local, in a sense that a small number (in this case $1$) of inputs can significantly influence the output of the function. The KLLM inequality shows that constant noise $\rho$ suffices for functions that are global, in a sense captured by what are known as \textit{generalised influences}.\\
Let $f:\{0,1\} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$. For $S \subseteq [n]$ and $x \in \{0,1\}^S$, we write $f_{S \rightarrow x}$ for the function obtained from $f$ by restricting the coordinates of $S$ according to $x$. In the case that $S$ is a singleton, that is $S = \{i\}$ for some $i \in [n]$, we write $f_{i \rightarrow x}$ instead. We write $|x|$ for the number of ones in $x$. For $i \in [n]$, the $i$th influence is $I_i(f)=||f_{i \rightarrow 1} - f_{i \rightarrow 0}||_2^2$, where the norm is with respect to the $\mu_p$ measure. In general, we define the influence with respect to any $S \subseteq [n]$ by sequentially applying the operators $f \mapsto f_{i \rightarrow 1}-f_{i \rightarrow 0}$ for all $i \in S$, as follows.

\begin{definition}[generalised influences]

For $f:\{0,1\}^n \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ and $S \subseteq [n]$ we let \[
I_S(f)=  \mathbb{E}_{\mu_p}\left[ \left(\sum_{x \in \{0,1\}^S}(-1)^{|S|-|x|}f_{S \rightarrow x} \right)^2 \right].\]We say $f$ has $\beta$-small generalised influences if $I_S[f] \le \beta~ \mathbb{E}[f^2]$ for all $S \subseteq [n].$
    
\end{definition}



We are now ready to state the KLLM hypercontractive inequality:

\begin{theorem}[\cite{keevash2024hypercontractivity}, Theorem 1.3]\label{KLLM hypercontractivity}

Let $p \in (0,\frac{1}{2}].$ Suppose $f \in L^2(\{0,1\}^n,\mu_p)$ has $\beta$-small generalised influences with respect to $p$. Then $||T_{1/5}f||_4 \le \beta^{1/4}||f||_2.$
    
\end{theorem}

As mentioned by the authors, their hypercontractive inequality is applicable to global functions, in a sense that changing a small number of input bits changes the output of the function with negligible probability. We will see a far reaching application of this in the penultimate chapter where it will be used in an extremal combinatorial setting.\\
In the next chapter we will cover an application of a local hypercontractive inequality in proving a result of Friedgut, Kalai, and Noar \cite{friedgut2002boolean} that links the size of the Fourier weights of a Boolean function to its similarity to a dictatorship.

\chapter{An overview of ``Boolean functions whose Fourier Transform is concentrated on the first two levels''}

In this chapter we will cover one of the first obtained results relevant to the junta method, by Friedgut, Kalai, and Naor \cite{friedgut2002boolean}. We will give an overview of the theorem, and key ideas used in the proof. This will then be used in the next chapter to prove a concrete stability result in an extremal combinatorics setting. The theorem is as follows:
\begin{theorem}[\cite{friedgut2002boolean}, Theorem 1.1]\label{Friedgut Main}
If $f$ is a Boolean function, $||f||_2^2=p$ and $\sum_{|S|>1}\widehat{f}(S)^2 \le \delta$ then either $p<K'\delta$ or $p>1-K'\delta$ or $||f(x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_n)-x_i||_2^2 \le K\delta$ for some $i$ or $||f(x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_n)-(1-x_i)||_2^2 \le K\delta$ for some $i$. Here $K'$ and $K$ are absolute constants.
\end{theorem}

In the original paper, the authors present two proofs of the above theorem. The first is based on a reduction to the case of weighted majority functions. The second, which we will give an overview of, is based around the Bonami-Beckner (hypercontractive) inequality, which we will state in the partial proof.

\begin{proof}
Our goal is to prove the following lemma: 
\begin{lemma}[\cite{friedgut2002boolean}, Lemma 3.1]\label{lemma 3.1 friedgut}Let $f$ be a Boolean function such that $\sum_{|S|>1}\widehat{f}(S)^2 = \epsilon$. Then there exists $i$ and $D_i$, which is a linear function of $x_i$ such that,\[||f-D_i||_2^2<\left(1+\frac{17946}{1/4-\epsilon}\right)\epsilon.\]
    
\end{lemma}
Since we have $(1+\frac{17946}{1/4-\epsilon})\epsilon=\Theta(\epsilon)$, Theorem \ref{Friedgut Main} follows as an immediate corollary of Lemma \ref{lemma 3.1 friedgut}.\\
Let $f$ satisfy the conditions as stated in Lemma \ref{lemma 3.1 friedgut}. Then it is without loss of generality that $f$ is balanced, that is to say $\mathbb{E}(f)=\frac{1}{2}$. Let $f(x)=f(x_1,\ldots, x_n)$ and define $g(x,y)=g(x_1,\ldots, x_n,y)$ where:

\begin{equation*}
g(x,y)=
    \begin{cases}
        f(x) & \text{when } $y=0$,\\
        1-f(1-x) & \text{when } $y=1$.
    \end{cases}
\end{equation*}\\
Here $1-x = (1-x_1,\ldots,1-x_n)^T$. We can see that $g$ is balanced by considering pairs of input vectors of the form $(x,0)$ and $(1-x,1)$. Simple analysis shows also that \[\sum_{|S|>1}\widehat{g}(S)^2=\sum_{|S|>1}\widehat{f}(S)^2,\]and if $g\approx D_i$ then $f \approx D_i$.\\
Following the notation used in \cite{friedgut2002boolean}, let \[S=\sum_{|T|\le 1}\widehat{f}(T)u_T,~~~~~~~~~~~~L=\sum_{|T|>1}\widehat{f}(T)u_T.\]where $S$ and $L$ stand for ``small'' and ``large'' respectively, and let $R=S^2-S$.\\
For the sake of demonstrating an application we will not prove all of the following lemmas, although full proofs can be found in \cite{friedgut2002boolean}.

\begin{lemma}[\cite{friedgut2002boolean}, Lemma 3.2]\label{lemma 3.2 friedgut}
    $\mathbb{E}(R^2)\le8748\epsilon$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{lemma}[\cite{friedgut2002boolean}, Lemma 3.4]\label{lemma 3.4 friedgut}
    Let $0<\alpha<1/4$ be a constant and let \[p=\mathbb{P}(|R|>\alpha).\]Then \[p \le \frac{16 \epsilon}{\alpha^2}.\]
\end{lemma}
\begin{lemma}[\cite{friedgut2002boolean}, Lemma 3.5]\label{lemma 3.5 friedgut}
    $\mathbb{E}(R^2) \le \frac{\alpha^2}{1-36\sqrt{\epsilon}/\alpha}.$
\end{lemma}
We will prove Lemma \ref{lemma 3.5 friedgut} assuming Lemma \ref{lemma 3.4 friedgut} holds. It is at this stage that we are able to invoke the first use of a hypercontractive inequality in a proof. We have the Bonami-Beckner inequality:
\begin{lemma}[Bonami \cite{bonami1970etude}, Beckner \cite{beckner1975inequalities}]\label{Bonami Beckner inequality}
Let $f:\{0,1\} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ be a function which is a linear combination of $\{u_T:|T|\le k\}$. Let $p >2$. Then \[||f||_p\le \left(\sqrt{p-1}\right)^k||f||_2.\]    
\end{lemma}
Consider the setting of Lemma \ref{lemma 3.5 friedgut} and denote $X=R^2$ and $Y=R^4$. Taking $p=4$ and $k=2$, the Bonami-Beckner inequality, Lemma \ref{Bonami Beckner inequality}, gives \[Y \le 81X^2.\]From this and Lemma \ref{lemma 3.4 friedgut} we have: 
\begin{flalign*}
    X &= \mathbb{E}(R^2) = (1-p)\mathbb{E}(R^2|R^2 \le \alpha)+ p\mathbb{E}(R^2|R^2>\alpha) &\\
    &\le (1-p)\alpha^2 + p\sqrt{\mathbb{E}(R^4|R^2>\alpha^2)} \le (1-p)\alpha^2+p\sqrt{\frac{Y}{p}} &\\
    &\le (1-p)\alpha^2+9X\sqrt{p} \le \alpha^2+\frac{4\sqrt{\epsilon}}{\alpha}9X.
\end{flalign*}
Rearranging yields the desired result of Lemma \ref{lemma 3.5 friedgut}. Picking the optimal $\alpha=54\sqrt{\epsilon}$ and substituting into Lemma \ref{lemma 3.5 friedgut} yields Lemma \ref{lemma 3.2 friedgut}.\\

Finally from Lemma \ref{lemma 3.2 friedgut} we have the following corollary:
\begin{corollary}[\cite{friedgut2002boolean}, Corollary 3.3]\label{corollary of Friedgut}
    There exists $i$ such that \[\widehat{f}(i)^2 \ge 1/4-\left(1+\frac{17496}{1/4-\epsilon}\right).\]
\end{corollary}
%Add stuff from page 434of the paper this is based on
\begin{proof} Since $\mathbb{E}(R^2)=\sum\widehat{R}(T)^2$ we have, summing over 2-sets, \[\sum_{i \neq j}\widehat{f}(i)^2\widehat{f}(j)^2\le8748\epsilon.\]
Furthermore since \[\mathbb{E}(S^2)=\widehat{f}(\emptyset)^2+\sum_{i=1}^n\widehat{f}(i)^2=1/2-\epsilon,\]utilising the assumption $f$ is balanced, we have $\widehat{f}(\emptyset)^2=\mathbb{E}(f)=\frac{1}{2}$, hence \[\sum_{i=1}^n\widehat{f}(i)^2=1/4-\epsilon.\]Therefore if $\max\widehat{f}(i)^2=\delta$,\[(1/4-\epsilon)^2 \le 2 \times 8748 \epsilon + (1/4-\epsilon)\delta.\]\end{proof}

We now note that Corollary \ref{corollary of Friedgut} directly implies Lemma \ref{lemma 3.1 friedgut}. Indeed under the assumption of $f$ being balanced we have $\widehat{f}(\emptyset)=1/2$ and $\sum \widehat{f}(T)^2=1/2$, hence:\[||f-1/2+\widehat{f}(i)u_i||_2^2=\sum_{\{T \neq i,\emptyset\}}\widehat{f}(T)^2\le\left(1+\frac{17496}{1/4-\epsilon}\right),\]concluding the proof.
\end{proof}
Some remarks on this proof. The use of the Bonami-Beckner inequality is used to bound higher moments of $R=S^2-S$ in terms of its second moment to show that its tail decreases fast enough. In the alternate proof it appears a similar technique is applied, however using more elementary methods revolving around standard techniques used in probabilistic arguments, as well as Hölders inequality.\\
We will use this result in the next chapter where we will prove another result of Friedgut \cite{friedgut2008measure} concerning extremal intersecting families.

\chapter{Applying hypercontractivity to prove stability. A toy example of the junta method in action}
A common question asked in extremal combinatorics usually revolves around describing an extremal structure. Once we know this we then may ask the following. Suppose we have a structure which is almost extremal. Does this imply the structure is almost the same as the unique extremal structure? This question is the core idea of stability. We will follow a familiar motivational example, considered in \cite{friedgut2008measure}, to better understand this idea, and how hypercontractivity can be used to prove such a property.

\begin{theorem}[\cite{erdos1961intersection}, Erd\H{o}s-Ko-Rado Theorem]\label{Edros ko rado}
For $r,n \in \mathbb{N}$ and $r\le n/2$, if $\mathcal{A} \subseteq[n]^{(r)}$ is intersecting then \[|\mathcal{A}| \le \binom{n-1}{r-1}.\] Moreover if $r < n/2$ we have $|\mathcal{A}| = \binom{n-1}{r-1}$ if and only if $\mathcal{A} = \{A \subseteq [n]:|A|=r \text{ and } x\in A\}$ for some arbitrary $x \in [n]$.

\end{theorem}

In \cite{frankl2003weighted}, it is noted that it can prove useful to consider weighted versions of these theorems outside of the uniform case. The measure theoretic analogue of the Erd\H{o}s-Ko-Rado theorem is as follows (possibly first proven, as mentioned by Friedgut, in \cite{fishburn1986probabilities}).

\begin{theorem}[\cite{fishburn1986probabilities}, Measure theoretic analogue of the Erd\H{o}s-Ko-Rado Theorem]\label{Analogue of EKR}
Let $0 \le p \le 1/2$ and let $\mathcal{A} \subseteq \{0,1\}^n$ be an intersecting family. Then $\mu_p(\mathcal{A}) \le p$. Furthermore, if $0<p<1/2$, then equality is attained if and only if $\mathcal{A}$ is a dictatorship.
    
\end{theorem}

Here a family $\mathcal{F}$ is known as a dictatorship if its (Boolean) characteristic function, $f:\{0,1\}^n \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$, is a dictatorship where, 
\begin{equation}
f(S)=
    \begin{cases}
        1 & \text{if } S \in \mathcal{F},\\
        0 & \text{otherwise.}
    \end{cases}
\end{equation}

Equivalently that is to say the value of $f(S)$ can be determined by observing whether a given element is in $S$ or not. Note that the constant functions $f(S)=0$ and $f(S)=1$ are, by definition, trivial dictatorships. These are the characteristic functions of the empty set and the power set of $[n]$ respectively.\\
For the remainder of this chapter we will follow a paper of Freidgut \cite{friedgut2008measure} which gives a strengthening of Theorem \ref{Analogue of EKR}, namely a stability result on families whose measure is almost equal to $p$. We will actually only prove a corollary of Friedgut's theorem, concerning intersecting sets, rather than the general $t$-intersecting sets covered in their paper, as to directly apply the result of the previous chapter in proving what will be known as Step 2.


\begin{corollary}[\cite{friedgut2008measure}, Theorem 1.3]\label{Friedgut stability theorem}
Let $0 \le p \le 1/2$ and let $\mathcal{A} \subseteq \{0,1\}^n$ be an intersecting family. Then if $\mu_p(A) = p -\epsilon$, there exists a dictatorship $\mathcal{B}$ such that $\mu_p(\mathcal{A} \oplus \mathcal{B})=c\epsilon$, where $c=c(p)$.

\end{corollary}

\begin{proof}

The key idea around proving this result is via spectral analysis of the characteristic function of $\mathcal{A}$. Friedgut's proof can be described in two steps. Let $f$ be the characteristic function of the intersecting set $\mathcal{A}$. Then we will proceed by showing the following:



\begin{enumerate}
    \item[Step 1.] If $\mathbb{E}(f)=p-o(1)$ then almost all of the weight of $\sum_{S\subseteq[n]}\widehat{f}(S)^2$ is concentrated on sets $S$ with $|S| \le 1$.
    \item[Step 2.] From this we will deduce that $f$ is well approximated by a dictatorship.
\end{enumerate}

For proving Step 1. we utilise some techniques from Boolean analysis. \\
Let $f = \sum\widehat{f}(S)\chi_S$ be the Fourier expansion of the characteristic function for $\mathcal{A}$\footnote{Here for convenience we drop the notation for summing over all subsets of [n] in the summand of the characteristic polynomial. $\chi_S$ is the monomial corresponding to the hypercube representation of a set $S$.}. For $\mu_p(\mathcal{A})=\alpha$, we know that $\widehat{f}(\emptyset)^2=\alpha^2$ and that $\sum_{S \neq \emptyset}\widehat{f}(S)^2=\alpha-\alpha^2$ (see \cite{o2014analysis}). Then there exists some $\tau$ such that the sum breaks down as, 
\[\sum_{|S|=1}\widehat{f}(S)^2=(\alpha-\alpha^2)(1-\tau),~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\sum_{|S|>1}\widehat{f}(S)^2=(\alpha-\alpha^2)\tau.\]
We will know quote a lemma and an equation from \cite{friedgut2008measure} which we shall use to perform the rest of the spectral analysis. Let $q=1-p$. Then we have,
%check

\begin{lemma}[\cite{friedgut2008measure}, Lemma 2.5]

Let $t \ge 1$ be an integer, and let $0 < p < \frac{1}{t+1}$. Then there exists a polynomial $Q(s)$ of degree $t-1$ such that if we denote $Q(s)(\frac{-p}{q})^s$ by $F(s)$ then \[F(0)=1, ~~~F(1)=F(2)=\ldots=F(t)=\frac{-p^t}{1-p^t}\]and for any integer $s>t$ it holds that $F(s)>\frac{-p^t}{1-p^t}$. 

    
\end{lemma}

\begin{equationenvironment}[\cite{friedgut2008measure}, Equation 9]\label{Equation 9 from Friedgut}
\[0=\alpha^2Q(0)+\sum_{S \ne \emptyset}(\frac{-p}{q})^{|S|}Q(|S|)\widehat{f}(S)^2\ge\alpha^2Q(0)+(\alpha-\alpha^2) \textnormal{min} \{(\frac{-p}{q})^sQ(s)\}.\]
\end{equationenvironment}

In the case $t=1$, we have that $\min\{F(s)\}=\frac{-p}{1-p}=m(p)=m$. Since $m<0$ and $F(s) \rightarrow 0$ as $s$ grows we have a ``spectral gap'', hence we can write \[\text{min}\{F(s):s>t, s \text{ is an integer}\}=m+\delta \tag{$\ast$}\]for some $\delta>0$. Combining this, the broken down sum of the Fourier expansion of $f$ and the fact that $Q(0)=1$, substituting into Equation \ref{Equation 9 from Friedgut} yields: 
\[0=\alpha^2+\sum_{S \ne \emptyset}F(|S|)\widehat{f}(S)^2 \ge \alpha^2+(\alpha-\alpha^2)(1-\tau)m+(\alpha-\alpha^2)\tau(m+\delta).\]We see that so long as $\tau$ is small enough such that $m+\tau\delta<0$, the above simplifies to \[\alpha \le \frac{-[m+\tau\delta]}{1-[m+\tau\delta]}.\]This fact alongside noting that \[\frac{d(\frac{-[m+\tau\delta]}{1-[m+\tau\delta]})}{d\tau}=\frac{-\delta}{(1-[m+\tau\delta])^2}=\theta(-\delta),\]gives us the following critical lemma:
\begin{lemma}[\cite{friedgut2008measure}, Lemma 2.7]\label{proof of point 1 in toy example of application of hypercontractivity}

    Let $0 \le p \le \frac{1}{t+1}$. Let $f = \sum \widehat{f}(S)\chi_S$ be the characteristic equation of a $t$-intersecting family $\mathcal{A}$ with $\mu_p(\mathcal{A})=\alpha$. Let $\tau \ge 0$, let $\sum_{t<|S|}\widehat{f}(S)^2=(\alpha-\alpha^2)\tau$, let $\epsilon \ge 0$ and let $\delta$ be as defined in $(\ast)$. Then if $\alpha \ge p^t - \epsilon$ this implies that $\tau < O(\frac{\epsilon}{\delta})$.
\end{lemma}

We take a pause here in the proof to note that Lemma \ref{proof of point 1 in toy example of application of hypercontractivity} precisely states what we were looking to show in Step 1 of the proof of Theorem \ref{Friedgut stability theorem}. Indeed, fixing $m$ and $\delta$ we see that $\frac{-[m+\tau\delta]}{1-[m+\tau\delta]}$ is a continuous decreasing function of $\tau$ near $\tau=0$. Hence if $\alpha$ is close to $p^t$, this implies that $\tau$ is close to $0$. That is to say $\sum_{t<|S|}\widehat{f}(S)^2=(\alpha-\alpha^2)\tau$ is ``small'', and so most of the weight of $\sum_{S \subseteq [n]}\widehat{f}(S)^2$ is concentrated on sets $S$ with $|S|\le t$ (in our case with $t =1$).\\
We are now ready to tackle the problem of proving Step 2. In proving only a corollary of the main theorem of \cite{friedgut2008measure}, we are able to appeal to Theorem \ref{Friedgut Main} directly which we saw in the previous chapter. Combining all of this we have that there exists some dictatorship characteristic function $g$ representing the family $\mathcal{B}$, such that $|f-g|_2^2=O(\epsilon)$, hence the set in which the two functions disagree, which is equivalent to the measure of the symmetric difference of $\mathcal{A}$ and $\mathcal{B}$ is of the order of $O(\epsilon)$, or equivalently, $\mu_p(\mathcal{A}\oplus\mathcal{B})=c\epsilon$, where $c=c(p)$.

%We note that the above theorem informally tells us that if we have such a Boolean function $f$ whose Fourier coefficients are concentrated on the lowest two levels ($|S|=0$ and $|S| = 1$) is well approximated by a constant function, or a dictatorship. This is the critical idea of the junta method. If we are able to show that the sum  $\sum_{|S|>1}\widehat{f}^2(S)$ is ``small'', we are able to infer that $f$ is close to a function $g$ that \textit{cannot} depend on many input bits. \\

%In our case here, a characteristic function $g$ that is constant represents one of either the empty set or the powerset of $[n]$, and in the case that $g$ is a dictator, represents a family $\mathcal{B}$, where $\mathcal{B} = \{S \subseteq [n]: i \in S \}$ for some arbitrary $i \in [n]$.\\



\end{proof}

%The key idea from this classical theorem that we are interested in is the latter part, which describes the structure of a maximal intersecting family. We will now introduce the definition of a junta with respect to a family. 

%\begin{definition}[Junta (family)]

%Let $j < k < n$ be non-negative integers. A family $\mathcal{J} \subseteq \binom{[n]}{r}$ is said to be a $j$-junta if there exists a set $J$ of size $j$, and a family $\mathcal{G} \subseteq \mathcal{P}(J)$, such that a set $A$ is in $\mathcal{J}$ if and only if $A \cap J$ is in $\mathcal{G}$.

%\end{definition}

%Consider the extremal families described in Theorem \ref{Edros ko rado}. We will show that this a $1$-junta. Letting $\mathcal{A} = \mathcal{J}$ for ease of notation, consider the set $J = \{x\}$ and the trivial family $\mathcal{G} = \{\{x\}\} \subseteq \mathcal{P}(J)$. It is clear that if some set $A$ is in $\mathcal{J}$, then $A \cap J = \{x\} \in \mathcal{G}$. Similarly if $A \cap J \in G$ then we must have $x \in A$, hence by construction, $A \in \mathcal{J}$. Since $|J| = 1$ we have that the set $\mathcal{J}=\mathcal{A}$ is a $1$-junta. \\

%Intuitively if a family is a $j$-junta, it means that we can determine whether a set belongs to such a family by only considering $j$ known elements of the set.\\

%We will follow a paper by Friedgut \cite{friedgut2008measure} to show that under select $\mu_p$ measures, via using spectral techniques as well as an application of a hypercontractive inequality, we are able to show that if a family has almost maximum measure, then it agrees highly with a maximal family.

\chapter{$K_3$ intersecting families}
In the previous chapter we showed only the stability result of the maximal size of an intersecting family. More exotic questions regard families which intersect in different ways. As mentioned previously, Theorem \ref{Friedgut stability theorem} is only actually a corollary of what Friegut proved. In fact he proved the result for generalised $t$-intersecting sets which we state for completeness:

\begin{theorem}[\cite{friedgut2008measure}, Theorem 1.3]\label{Friedgut generalised EKR for general t}
Let $t \ge 1$ be an integer, let $0<p<\frac{1}{t+1}$ and let $\mathcal{A} \subseteq \{0,1\}^n$ be a $t$-intersecting family. Then 
\begin{enumerate}
    \item $\mu_p(\mathcal{A}) \le p^t.$
    \item \textbf{Uniqueness:} If $\mu_p(\mathcal{A})=p^t$ then $\mathcal{A}$ is a $t$-umvirate.
    \item \textbf{Stability:} If $\mu_p(\mathcal{A})=p^t-\epsilon$ then there exists a $t$-umvirate $\mathcal{B}$ such that \\$\mu_p(\mathcal{A}\oplus\mathcal{B})=c\epsilon$ where $c=c(p)$.
\end{enumerate}
    
\end{theorem}

Note that Theorem \ref{Analogue of EKR} and Theorem \ref{Friedgut stability theorem} precisely state Theorem \ref{Friedgut generalised EKR for general t} in the case $t=1$.\\
For the remainder of this chapter we attempt to cover the following extremal intersection problem.

\begin{center}
\textit{What is the maximal size of a set-system of graphs such that all graphs pairwise intersect on a copy of $K_3$? Can we infer anything about such a set systems structure? Does stability hold?}  
\end{center}

Firstly we note a somewhat obvious but key difference to the previous intersection problem covered in chapter 4. A graph is itself a family comprised of $2$-sets, so a family of graphs on $n$ vertices can be viewed as a subset of $\{0,1\}^{[n]^{(2)}}$. This change to the structure of the ground set makes it much more difficult to apply standard combinatorial methods that are used when the ground set is $[n]$. We will see that heavy reliance on spectral analysis as well as a strong result concerning odd cycles will be necessary when solving the $K_3$ problem. Finally before beginning, we note also the relevance to the core theme of this dissertation, the junta method for stability results. We will see in this problem that hypercontractivity will only need to be utilised for proving the stability result. However in order to carry out this step we will need to first have proven both the maximal size and structure of the set-system first. That is to say that usually when applying such methods we prove the 3 results; maximality, uniqueness, stability in said order.\\
The main theorem of Ellis, Filmus, and Friedgut is as follows:

\begin{theorem}[\cite{ellis2012triangle}, Theorem 1.4]\label{ELLIS TRIANGLE JUNTA THEOREM}A triangle junta is a family of all subgraphs of $K_n$ with a prescribed intersection with a given triangle. In the case where a triangle junta is the family of all graphs containing a given triangle, we call this family a 
 triangle-umvirate. Then:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{[Extremal families]} Let $p \le 1/2$, and let $\mathcal{F}$ be an odd-cycle-intersecting family of subgraphs of $K_n$. Then $\mu_p(\mathcal{F}) \le p^3$, with equality if and only if $\mathcal{F}$ is a triangle-umvirate. Furthermore, in the case $p=1/2$, if $\mathcal{F}$ is odd-cycle-agreeing then $\mu(\mathcal{F})\le 1/8$, with equality if and only if $\mathcal{F}$ is a triangle junta.
    \item \textbf{[Stability]} For each $p \le 1/2$ there exists a constant $c_p$ (bounded for $p \in [\delta,1/2]$, for any fixed $\delta>0$) such that for any $\epsilon \ge 0$, if $\mathcal{F}$ is an odd-cycle-intersecting family with $\mu_p(\mathcal{F}) \ge p^3-\epsilon$ then there exists a triangle-umvirate $\mathcal{Z}$ such that \[\mu_p(\mathcal{Z}\oplus\mathcal{F}) \le c_p\epsilon.\]For $p=1/2$, the corresponding statement holds for odd-cycle agreeing families.
\end{enumerate}
\end{theorem}

\section{Bipartite graphs}

The proof as written in \cite{ellis2012triangle} is split into two cases. It is first proven for $p=1/2$, and then for $p<1/2$. Our starting point is the following simple observation. Given a triangle intersecting family $\mathcal{F}$ and some bipartite graph $B$, then the intersection of any two graphs in $F_1,F_2 \in \mathcal{F}$ must have non-empty intersection with $\overline{B}$. This simply follows from the fact that if $F_1 \cap F_2 \cap \overline{B}=\emptyset$ then $F_1 \cap F_2 \cap B = F_1 \cap F_2 \supseteq K_3$, a contradiction since $B$ is bipartite. A different way of stating this observation is the following claim which we verify independently.

\begin{claim}\label{Bipartite graph observation}If $\mathcal{F}$ is a triangle intersecting family, $G \in \mathcal{F}$, and $B$ is a bipartite graph then \[G \in \mathcal{F} \implies (G \oplus \overline{B}) \notin \mathcal{F}. \]
    
\end{claim}
\begin{proof}
    Suppose for a contradiction. Identifying graphs by their characteristic vectors from $\{0,1\}^{[n]^{(2)}}$, let $A_1 = \{0,1\}^{[n]^{(2)}} \backslash (G \cup B)$, $A_2 = G \backslash B$, $A_3 = G \cap B$, and $A_4 = B \backslash G$. Then $A_1, A_2, A_3$, and $A_4$ partition $\{0,1\}^{[n]^{(2)}}$, $G = A_2 \cup A_3$, $B = A_3 \cup A_4$ and $G \oplus \overline{B} = A_1 \cup A_3$. Hence $K_3 \subseteq G \cap (G \oplus \overline{B}) = (A_2 \cup A_3) \cap (A_1 \cup A_3) = A_3 \subseteq B$, a contradiction.
\end{proof}

As mentioned by the authors, this suggests working in a group setting and replacing ``intersecting'' with ``agreeing'', where a triangle agreeing family $\mathcal{F}$ is one where for any two sets $F_1,F_2 \in \mathcal{F}$, we have that $\overline{F_1 \oplus F_2}$ contains a copy of $K_3$. Here the group is defined by the set $\mathbb{Z}_2^{[n]^{(2)}}$, and the group operator is given by the XOR operation, denoted by $+$. This inspires the idea of considering operators $A_B$, Boolean functions which act on functions whose domain is the set of subgraphs of $K_n$, such that: \[A_Bf(G)=f(G+\overline{B})\] where $f$ is the characteristic function of a family $\mathcal{F}$. We can extend this to the case $\mathcal{B}$ is a distribution over bipartite graphs, defining the operator: \[A_{\mathcal{B}}f(G)=\mathbb{E}[f(G+\overline{B})]\]where the expectation is over a random choice of $B$ from $\mathcal{B}$. Note that in the case $\mathcal{F}$ is triangle intersecting, whenever $f(G)=1$, we have $A_{\mathcal{B}}f(G)=0$, hence \[\langle f,A_{\mathcal{B}}f \rangle = 0.\]The key idea is to identify the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of $A$ and use the above equation to deduce information about the Fourier transform of $f$, and hence of $\mathcal{F}$. For this we will need to consider Hoffman's bounds on the size of an independent set in a graph.

\section{Cayley graphs and independent sets}
Now that we are working in a group setting, it becomes natural to consider an appropriate Cayley graph.

\begin{definition}[Cayley graph]Let $G$ be a group, and let $S \subseteq G$ be a set of group elements such that the identity element $I \notin S$. The Cayley graph associated with $(G,S)$, denoted $\Gamma = \Gamma(G,S)$, is then defined as the directed graph having one vertex associated with each group element of $G$ and directed edges $(g,h)$ whenever $gh^{-1} \in S$.
\end{definition}

In the setting above consider $G=\mathbb{Z}_2^{[n]^{(2)}}$ and $S$ to be the set of all graphs $\overline{B}$ where $B$ is bipartite. Then we have the Cayley graph \[\Gamma = \Gamma(\mathbb{Z}_2^{[n]^{(2)}},\{\overline{B}:B \subseteq K_n, B \text{ is bipartite}\}).\footnote{Note that in this case $\Gamma$ does indeed satisfy the conditions of a Cayley graph, namely $K_n$ is not bipartite, hence $\overline{K_n} = \emptyset = I$ is not in S.}\]We now verify independently the following claim, that an odd-cycle-agreeing family of subgraphs of $K_n$ is precisely an independent set in this graph.

\begin{claim}\label{claim 2}
    $\mathcal{I}$ is an independent set in $\Gamma$ if and only if $\mathcal{I}$ is an odd-cycle-agreeing family.
\end{claim}
\begin{proof}
    Note that the group is abelian. Suppose $\mathcal{I}$ is an independent set in $\Gamma$. Then for any two elements in $I_1,I_2 \in \mathcal{I}$, we have \[I_2 \oplus I_1^{-1} = I_2 \oplus I_1 \notin \{\overline{B}:B \subseteq K_n, B \text{ is bipartite}\}.\] Hence $\overline{I_2 \oplus I_1}$ is \textbf{not} bipartite, hence contains an odd cycle.\\
     Consider some triangle-agreeing-family $\mathcal{F}$ and suppose it is not an independent set in $\Gamma$. Then there exists two graphs $F_1,F_2 \in \mathcal{F}$ such that $F_2 \oplus F_1^{-1} = F_2 \oplus F_1 \in \{\overline{B}:B \subseteq K_n, B \text{ is bipartite}\}.$ Hence there exists some bipartite graph $B^*$ such that $F_2 \oplus F_1 = \overline{B^*}$, hence $\overline{F_2 \oplus F_1}= B^*$, a contradiction to the fact $\mathcal{F}$ is odd-cycle-agreeing.
\end{proof}

We prove this result as it demonstrates a simple yet critical fact. Whatever follows in the proof utilises the nice properties of bipartite graphs. It turns out that when dealing with families of graphs that intersect on larger cliques, we have to try a different approach as the generalisation of bipartite to considering chromatic number fails due to not having this ``if and only if'' result (see \cite{berger2023k4} for recent work on this).\\
We will now state and prove one of the critical theorems from \cite{ellis2012triangle} (Theorem 2.2) which concerns bounding the size of an independent set in a graph with respect to its eigenvalues from its matrix representation. We first present the relevant definitions and claims. First for any two functions $f,g:\mathbb{Z}_2^{[n]^{(2)}} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$, we define their inner product as \[\langle f,g \rangle = \mathbb{E}(f \cdot g) = \frac{1}{2^{\binom{n}{2}}}\sum_{S \subseteq [n]^{(2)}}f(S)g(S).\]

\begin{definition}[parity function]
    For every subset $R$ of $[n]^{(2)}$ we define the parity function $\chi_R:\mathbb{Z}_2^{[n]^{(2)}}\rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ by \[\chi_R(S)=(-1)^{|R \cap S|}.\]
\end{definition}
We note that the parity function is the generalised form of the monomial corresponding to $R$ and is a character in the relevant group, namely for any two $S,T \subseteq [n]^{(2)}$ we have \[\chi_R(S \oplus T)=\chi_R(S) \cdot \chi_R(T).\]
Furthermore we verify the following claim:
\begin{claim}\label{claim 3}
    The set $\{\chi_R:R \subseteq [n]^{(2)}\}$ is an orthonormal basis for the vector space $\mathbb{R}[\mathbb{Z}_2^{[n]^{(2)}}]$ of all real-valued functions on $\mathbb{Z}_2^{[n]^{(2)}}$.
\end{claim}

\begin{proof}
    It suffices to show that \begin{equation*}
\langle \chi_R, \chi_S \rangle=
    \begin{cases}
        1 & \text{if } \mathnormal{R}=\mathnormal{S},\\
        0 & \text{otherwise }.
    \end{cases}
\end{equation*}
Observe that for all $T \subseteq [n]^{(2)}$, \[\chi_R(T) \cdot \chi_S(T)=(-1)^{|R\cap T|}\cdot(-1)^{|S \cap T|}=(-1)^{|(R \oplus S) \cap T|}=\chi_{R \oplus S}(T).\]
It is trivial that $\mathbb{E}(\chi_{\emptyset})=1$. Otherwise for $y_i \in \{-1,1\}$ we have \[\mathbb{E}(\chi_U)=\mathbb{E}(\underset{i \in U}{\prod}y_i).\]Since expectation is with respect to a distribution of graphs which are independently distributed, we have that the edges are also independently distributed, hence we can switch the expectation with the product. That is to say, 
\[\mathbb{E}(\underset{i \in U}{\prod}y_i)=\underset{i \in U}{\prod}\mathbb{E}(y_i)=\underset{i \in U}{\prod}0=0,\]since $U \neq \emptyset.$ Combining all of this with the definition of the inner product completes the proof.
\end{proof}

Hence every function $f:\mathbb{Z}_2^{[n]^{(2)}} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ has a unique expansion of the form \begin{equation}\label{Fourier walsh basis wrt character functions K_3}
    f = \underset{R \subseteq [n]^{(2)}}{\sum}\widehat{f}(R)\chi_R.
\end{equation}
\begin{definition}[OCC operator]
    A linear operator $A$ on real-valued functions with domain $\mathbb{Z}_2^{[n]^{(2)}}$ is defined as being OCC (Odd-Cycle-Cayley) if it satisfies the following properties:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item If $\mathcal{F}$ is an odd-cycle-agreeing family, and $f$ is its characteristic function, then \[f(G)=1 \implies Af(G)=0.\]
        \item The Fourier basis is a complete set of eigenfunctions of $A$.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{definition}
For each $G \subseteq K_n$, denote $\lambda_G$ to be the eigenvalue corresponding to the parity function $\chi_G$. Write $\Lambda = (\lambda_G)_{G \subseteq K_n}$ to be the vector of eigenvalues of a given OCC operator. We will refer to $\Lambda$ as an OCC spectrum. Let $\lambda_{\text{min}}$ denote the minimum eigenvalue, and $\Lambda_{\text{min}}$ denote the set of graphs $G$ such that $\lambda_G=\lambda_{\text{min}}$. The spectral gap of $\Lambda$ is the maximal $\gamma$ such that $\lambda_H \ge \lambda_{\text{min}}+\gamma$ for all $H \notin \Lambda_{\text{min}}$.\\
We then have the following:

\begin{claim}[\cite{ellis2012triangle}, Claim 1]\label{A_B is OCC operator}\label{claim 4}
$A_{\mathcal{B}}$ is an OCC operator, and its spectrum is given by \[\lambda_R = (-1)^{|R|}\mathbb{E}[\chi_B(R)].\]
    
\end{claim}
\begin{proof}
    Consider an odd-cycle agreeing family $\mathcal{F}$ and its characteristic function $f$ then \[f(G)=1 \implies A_{\mathcal{B}}f(G)=0.\]
    Now for a parity function $\chi_R$ we have, with expectation with respect to the distribution $\mathcal{B}$: \[A_\mathcal{B}\chi_R(G)=\mathbb{E}[\chi_R(G \oplus \overline{B})]=\mathbb{E}[\chi_R(G)\cdot \chi_R(\overline{B})]=\chi_R(G)\cdot \mathbb{E}[\chi_R(\overline{B})]. \] That is to say the Fourier characters are eigenfunctions of $A_\mathcal{B}$, with \[\lambda_R=\mathbb{E}[\chi_R(\overline{B})].\]Observing that $(-1)^{|R||R\cap B|}=(-1)^{2|R \cap B|+|R \cap \overline{B}|}=(-1)^{|R \cap \overline{B}|}$, rewriting yields \[\lambda_R=\mathbb{E}[\chi_R(\overline{B})]=\mathbb{E}[(-1)^{|R \cap \overline{B}|}]=\mathbb{E}[(-1)^{|R||R \cap B|}]=(-1)^{|R|}\mathbb{E}[\chi_B(R)].\]
\end{proof}
We are now finally ready to state and prove the following weighted version of Hoffman's theorem \cite{hoffman2003eigenvalues}.

\begin{theorem}[\cite{ellis2012triangle}, Theorem 2.2]\label{Ellis main theorem}
    Let $\Lambda$ be an OCC spectrum with $\lambda_{\emptyset}=1$, $-1 < \lambda_{\text{min}}< 0$, and $\gamma >0$. Set $\nu = \frac{-\lambda_{\text{min}}}{1-\lambda_{\text{min}}}$. Then for any odd-cycle-agreeing family $\mathcal{F}$ of subgraphs of $K_n$ we have: \begin{enumerate}
        \item \textbf{[Upper bound]} $\mu(\mathcal{F})\le \nu.$
        \item \textbf{[Uniqueness]} If $\mu(\mathcal{F})=\nu$ then $\widehat{\mathcal{F}}(G) \neq 0$ only if $G \in \Lambda_{\text{min}} \cup \{\emptyset\}.$
        \item \textbf{[Stability]} Let $w=\sum_{G \notin \Lambda_{\text{min}}\cup \{\emptyset\}}\widehat{\mathcal{F}}(G)^2$. Then \[w \le \frac{\nu}{(1-\nu)\gamma}(\nu-\mu(\mathcal{F}))=O(\nu-\mu(\mathcal{F})).\]
    \end{enumerate}
\end{theorem}



\begin{proof}
Let A be an OCC operator with spectrum $\Lambda$. Then from Equation \ref{Fourier walsh basis wrt character functions K_3} and Claim \ref{A_B is OCC operator} we have: \[A(\mathcal{F})=\sum_G \lambda_G\widehat{\mathcal{F}}(G)\chi_G,\]and hence \[0=\langle \mathcal{F}, A\mathcal{F} \rangle = \sum_G \lambda_G \widehat{\mathcal{F}}(G)^2. \footnote{We abuse notation here replacing $f$ with $\mathcal{F}$ where $f$ is the characteristic function of $\mathcal{F}.$}\]Recalling that $\widehat{\mathcal{F}}(\emptyset)=\sum_G \widehat{\mathcal{F}}(G)=\mu(\mathcal{F})$, since $\emptyset \notin \Lambda_{\text{min}}$ we have \[\sum_{G \in \Lambda_{\text{min}}}\widehat{\mathcal{F}}(G)^2=\mu(\mathcal{F})-\mu(F)^2-w,\]where \[w = \sum_{G \notin \Lambda_{\text{min}}\cup \{\emptyset\}}\widehat{\mathcal{F}}(G)^2.\]Hence, 
\begin{flalign*}
0 = \sum_G \lambda_G \widehat{\mathcal{F}}(G)^2 &\ge  \lambda_{\emptyset}\mu(\mathcal{F})^2 + \lambda_{\text{min}}(\mu(\mathcal{F})-\mu(\mathcal{F})^2-w)+(\lambda_{\text{min}}+\gamma)w&\\& =\mu(\mathcal{F})^2-\frac{\nu}{1-\nu}(\mu(\mathcal{F})-\mu(\mathcal{F})^2-w)+w(\gamma-\frac{\nu}{1-\nu})&\\
     & =\frac{\mu(\mathcal{F})^2}{1-\nu}-\frac{\mu(\mathcal{F})\nu}{1-\nu}+w\gamma.
\end{flalign*}
Hence, as $1-\nu$ is positive on the prescribed range of $\lambda_{\text{min}}$, we have,\[\mu(\mathcal{F})^2-\mu(\mathcal{F})\nu+w\gamma(1-\nu) \le 0.\]Since $w\gamma(1-\nu) \ge 0$ with equality if and only if $w=0$ we have that $\mu(\mathcal{F}) \le \nu$. Indeed, suppose $\mu(\mathcal{F}) > \nu$. Then we have a contradiction: \[0 \ge
\mu(\mathcal{F})^2-\mu(\mathcal{F})\nu+w\gamma(1-\nu) > w\gamma(1-\nu) = w\gamma(1-\nu) \ge 0.\]Hence $\mu(\mathcal{F}) \le \nu$, with equality if and only if $w=0$ (confirming the upper bound and uniqueness result). Therefore, \[\mu(\mathcal{F})^2-\mu(\mathcal{F})\nu + w\gamma(1-\nu)\frac{\mu(\mathcal{F})}{\nu} \le 0.\]Cancelling and rearranging, noting that $\mu(\mathcal{F})$, $ \nu $, $(1-\nu)$ and $\gamma$ are all strictly positive, yields: \[w \le \frac{\nu}{(1-\nu)\gamma}(\nu-\mu(\mathcal{F})),\]concluding the stability result and hence the proof.
\end{proof}

From this we derive the following critical corollary. It is here where we will introduce a result whose basis is an application of hypercontractivity.

\begin{corollary}[\cite{ellis2012triangle}, Corollary 2.3]\label{corollary of ellis}
Suppose that there exists an OCC spectrum $\Lambda$ with eigenvalues $\lambda_{\emptyset}=1$, $\lambda_{\text{min}}=-1/7$ and spectral gap $\gamma>0$. Assume that all graphs in $\Lambda_{\text{min}}$ have at most 3 edges. Then if $\mathcal{F}$ is an odd-cycle-agreeing family of subgraphs of $K_n$ it holds that:
\begin{enumerate}
        \item \textbf{[Upper bound]} $\mu(\mathcal{F})\le 1/8.$
        \item \textbf{[Uniqueness]} If $\mu(\mathcal{F})=1/8$ then $\mathcal{F}$ is a triangle junta.
        \item \textbf{[Stability]} If $\mu(\mathcal{F}) \ge 1/8 - \epsilon$, then there exists a triangle junta $\mathcal{Z}$ such that $\mu(\mathcal{F} \oplus \mathcal{Z}) \le c\epsilon$, where $c>0$ is an absolute constant.
    \end{enumerate}
    
\end{corollary}
Before proving the corollary we will need to following lemma in order to prove the stability result.

\begin{lemma}[\cite{ellis2012triangle}, see proof of Corollary 2.3]\label{G is odd cycle agreeing}
    If $\frac{c_0}{7\gamma}\epsilon < 2^{-T_0}$ then $\mathcal{G}$ is odd-cycle-agreeing.  \end{lemma} \begin{proof}
        Suppose for a contradiction that there are two distinct graphs $G_1,G_2 \in \mathcal{G}$, supported on $A$ and which do not agree on an odd cycle. Consider now for $i \in \{1,2\}$ the sets \[\mathcal{F}_i=\{F \in \mathcal{F}:F \cap A = G_i \cap A\},\] and assume that $\mu(\mathcal{F}_1)+\mu(\mathcal{F}_2)>2^{-|A|}$. Observe that for each $i$ we have that \[\mu(\mathcal{F}_i)\le \mu(\mathcal{P}(\overline{A}))=\frac{2^{|\overline{A}|}}{2^{\binom{n}{2}}}=\frac{2^{\binom{n}{2}-|A|}}{2^{\binom{n}{2}}}=2^{-|A|}.\]Hence the pigeonhole principle implies that there must exist two graphs $J_1$ and $J_2$ that partition $\overline{A}$ and are such that $H_1 = G_1 \cup J_1 \in \mathcal{F}_1$ and $H_2 = G_2 \cup J_2 \in \mathcal{F}_2.$ Since $H_1$ and $H_2$ are in $\mathcal{F}$ and their agreement $\overline{H_1 \oplus H_2} = \overline{G_1 \oplus G_2}$ does not contain a triangle, it must be the case that $\mu(\mathcal{F}_1)+\mu(\mathcal{F}_2) \le 2^{-|A|}$. This implies that the distance between $\mathcal{F}$ and $\mathcal{G}$ is bounded below by $2^{-|A|} \ge 2^{-T_0}$, a contradiction.
        \end{proof}

        We are now ready to prove Corollary \ref{corollary of ellis}.
        
\begin{proof}[Proof of Corollary \ref{corollary of ellis}.]Unlike in the proof of Theorem \ref{Ellis main theorem}, we will prove each of the three results separately.\\
    $\bullet$ \textbf{Upper bound.} The upper bound follows immediately from Theorem \ref{Ellis main theorem}.\\
    $\bullet$ \textbf{Uniqueness.} We prove the uniqueness result under the (weaker) assumption that $\mathcal{F}$ is an odd-cycle-intersecting family rather than an odd-cycle-agreeing family. Without loss of generality $\mathcal{F}$ is an up-set, otherwise we may replace $\mathcal{F}$ with its up-filter. Noting that $1/8 = 1/2^3$ we are able to apply the following lemma of Friedgut, from the same paper covered in the previous chapter: 
    \begin{lemma}[\cite{friedgut2008measure}, Lemma 2.8]\label{lemma 2.8 friedgut}
    Let $N \in \mathbb{N}$, let $p \le 1/2$ and suppose $f:\{0,1\}^N \rightarrow \{0,1\}$ is a monotone Boolean function with $\mathbb{E}_p[f]=p^t$, and $\widehat{f}(S)=0$ whenever $|S|>t$. Then $f$ is a $t$-umvirate (depends only on $t$ coordinates). 
        
    \end{lemma}
    Since we have assumed that all graphs in $\Lambda_{\text{min}}$ have at most 3 edges, we are in the case where $w=0$ in Theorem \ref{Ellis main theorem}. That is to say $\widehat{f}(S)=0$ whenever $|S|>3$, hence we are able to apply Lemma \ref{lemma 2.8 friedgut} with $p=1/2$. Since $\mathcal{F}$ is odd-cycle-agreeing and depends only on $3$ coordinates, it certainly must be the case then that $\mathcal{F}$ is a triangle junta.\\
    $\bullet$
    \textbf{Stability.} We require the following theorem of Kindler and Safra:\footnote{As mentioned by Ellis, Filmus, and Friedgut, a convenient trait of Theorem \ref{Kindler badboy} is that as soon as the Fourier weight on the higher levels is small enough, the number of coordinates needed for the approximating family does not grow.
    Ironically this fact means that in the case where a family is approximated by a junta where the approximating family \textbf{does} grow as a function of $n$ (e.g. a star on $v=v(n)$ vertices) we cannot reasonably apply it.}
    
    \begin{theorem}[\cite{kindler2002noise}, Theorem 3]\label{Kindler badboy}
    For every $t \in \mathbb{N}$, there exists $\epsilon_0>0, c_0 >0,$ and $T_0\in \mathbb{N}$ such that the following holds. Let $N \in \mathbb{N}$, and let $f:\{0,1\}^N \rightarrow \{0,1\}$ be a Boolean function such that \[\sum_{|S|>t}\widehat{f}(S)^2=\epsilon < \epsilon_0.\]Then there exists a Boolean function $g:\{0,1\}^N \rightarrow \{0,1\}$, depending on at most $T_0$ coordinates, such that \[\mu(\{R:f(R) \neq g(R)\}) \le c_0\epsilon.\]
    
    \end{theorem}
    Again taking the weaker assumption, assume that $\mathcal{F}$ is odd-cycle-agreeing and that $\mu(\mathcal{F})=1/8-\epsilon$. Then from Theorem \ref{Ellis main theorem} we have \[w = \sum_{G \notin \Lambda_{\text{min}}\cup \{\emptyset\}}\widehat{\mathcal{F}}(G)^2\le \frac{1}{7\gamma}\epsilon.\]Applying Theorem \ref{Kindler badboy} with $t=3$ we have that provided $\epsilon \le 7\gamma\epsilon_0$, $\mathcal{F}$ is $(\frac{c_0}{7\gamma}\epsilon)$-close to some family $\mathcal{G}$ depending on some set $A$ of at most $T_0$ edges. Consider then the set of families $\mathcal{G}$ as defined above which are not triangle juntas. There are only a finite number of such families, and by the uniqueness result, all have measure $\mu(\mathcal{G})<1/8$, hence there exists $\epsilon_1>0$ such that for all such $\mathcal{G}$ we have, \[\mu(\mathcal{G})< 1/8-(1+\frac{c_0}{7\gamma})\epsilon_1.\]If $\mathcal{F}$ is $(\frac{c_0}{7\gamma}\epsilon)$-close to one such $\mathcal{G}$, then we have that $\mu(\mathcal{F})<1/8-\epsilon_1$, hence if $\epsilon \le \epsilon_1 $, it cannot be the case that $\mu(\mathcal{F}) \ge 1/8 - \epsilon$, and so the approximating family must be a triangle junta. Hence if \[\epsilon \ge \min(7\gamma \epsilon_0, \epsilon_1, \frac{7\gamma}{c_0}2^{-T_0})=\epsilon_2,\]we have by Theorem \ref{Kindler badboy} that $\mathcal{F}$ is $(\frac{c_0}{7\gamma}\epsilon)$-close to an approximating family $\mathcal{G}$ which is a triangle junta, and from Lemma \ref{G is odd cycle agreeing} $\mathcal{G}$ is odd cycle agreeing. Selecting $c = 1/\epsilon_2$ completes the proof of the stability result.
\end{proof}
\section{The agreeing-intersecting equivalency and the required OCC spectrum}
We note here that even with Corollary \ref{corollary of ellis}, we are still far from proving the centre piece of this chapter, Theorem \ref{ELLIS TRIANGLE JUNTA THEOREM}. Namely Corollary \ref{corollary of ellis} concerns $\mathcal{F}$ which are odd-cycle-agreeing, whereas in Theorem \ref{ELLIS TRIANGLE JUNTA THEOREM} we upgrade this to the stronger case where $\mathcal{F}$ is odd-cycle-intersecting. It is shown that, through the use of compression operators, that the agreeing-intersecting family equivalence does indeed hold, the proof of which is loosely based of the proof of an observation by Chung, Frankl, Graham, and Shearer (\cite{chung1986some}, Fact 1).\\ 
Secondly we have not actually shown whether there does indeed exist an OCC spectrum with the required properties as described in Corollary \ref{corollary of ellis}, hence if not we have no real way of applying the corollary. It is the proof of the existence of such a spectrum which is the main concern of \cite{ellis2012triangle}, and we direct the reader to this paper to see a full proof. We omit the proof of both these results as they are more centred around spectral analysis techniques, and do not so much concern a direct application of hypercontractivity. 

\chapter{A junta approximation dependent on global hypercontractivity}

In this penultimate chapter we will give a brief discussion on a new paper by Keevash, Lifshitz, Long, and Minzer \cite{keevash2024turan}, which concerns a junta approximation concerning forbidden expanded hypergraphs. The paper we will be following is currently submitted for publication and for the reader's convenience a preliminary version of these results is available online at https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.05568 (parts IV and V). For completeness we will state the core underpinning sharp threshold result.


\begin{theorem}[\cite{keevash2024hypercontractivity}, Theorem 1.9]\label{KLLM sharp threshold}
For any $\zeta > 0$ there is $C_0>1$ so that for any $\epsilon,p,q\in(0,1/2)$ with $q \ge (1+\zeta)p$ and $C > C_0$, writing $r=C\log(\epsilon^{-1})$ and $\delta = C^{-r}$, any monotone $(r,\delta)$-global Boolean function $f$ whose $p$-biased measure is at most $\delta$ satisfies \[\mu_q(f) \ge \epsilon^{-1}\mu_p(f).\]
    
\end{theorem}
The junta approximation result that we will consider is as follows:

\begin{theorem}[\cite{keevash2024turan}, Theorem 1.8]\label{KLLM Junta approx}
Let $G \in \mathcal{G}(r,s,\Delta)$ and $C \gg r\Delta\epsilon^{-1}$. Then for any $G^+$-free $\mathcal{F}\subseteq \binom{[n]}{k}$ with $C \le k \le n/Cs$, there is $J \subseteq V(G)$ with $|J| \le \sigma(G)-1$ and $|\mathcal{F} \backslash \mathcal{S}_{n,k,J}| \le \epsilon|\mathcal{S}_{n,k,\sigma(G)-1}|$.
    
\end{theorem}

The key observation here that makes this result so special is that we are able to approximate $\mathcal{F}$ by a generalised star (defined in the next subsection). Unlike the previous two chapters which covered extremal structures approximated by juntas which did not scale up with $n$ nor other increasing input variables, here the generalised star does. Intuitively this makes sense due to the nature of the global hypercontractivity result the junta approximation is based of. Throughout their paper there are two pseudorandomness concepts which are fundamental throughout. We explain these in the next subsection as well as other necessary definitions.

\section{Globalness, uncapturability and other key definitions}
In this subsection we define the key notions of globalness and uncapturability as well as numerous other necessary definitions needed in the proof of Theorem \ref{KLLM Junta approx}. First we need the following definition:

\begin{definition}[$\mathcal{F}_J^B$]
    Given a family $\mathcal{F} \subseteq \{0,1\}^X$ and $B \subseteq J \subseteq X$ we write $\mathcal{F}_J^B$ for the family \[\mathcal{F}_J^B=\{A \in \{0,1\}^{X \backslash J}: A \cup B \in \mathcal{F}\} \subseteq \{0,1\}^{X \backslash J}.\]In the case that $\{v\}$ is a singleton composed of the element $v$, we refer to $\mathcal{F}_v^v \equiv \mathcal{F}_{\{v\}}^{\{v\}}$ as the exclusive link of $v$ in $\mathcal{F}$.
\end{definition}
We are now ready to define the two pseudorandomness concepts:
\begin{definition}[core pseudorandomness definitions]
Let $\mathcal{F} \subseteq \{0,1\}^n$ and $\mu$ be a measure on $\{0,1\}^n$. Then we have the following: \begin{enumerate}
    \item $\mathcal{F}$ is $(\mu,a,\epsilon)$-uncapturable if $\mu(\mathcal{F}_J^{\emptyset}) \ge \epsilon$ for all $J \subseteq [n]$ with $|J|\le a $.
    \item $\mathcal{F}$ is $(\mu,a,\epsilon)$-global if $\mu(\mathcal{F}_J^J) \le \epsilon$ for all $J \subseteq [n]$ with $|J| \le a$.
\end{enumerate}    
    We say that $\mathcal{F}$ is $(\mu,a,\epsilon)$-capturable and/or $(\mu,a,\epsilon)$-local if it is not $(\mu,a,\epsilon)$-uncapturable and/or $(\mu,a,\epsilon)$-global respectively. If it is clear from the context what $\mu$ is we will usually omit it from the notation.
\end{definition} 
As mentioned in \cite{keevash2024hypercontractivity}, informally a family is uncapturable if there is no small set that intersects with most of its members, and global if one is unable to obtain a significant density increase through restricting the family to a subset composed of members containing some small fixed set. We now present the remaining necessary definitions which will be used in the next subsection.

\begin{definition}[$\mathcal{G}(r,s,\Delta)$ and $\mathcal{G}'(r,s,\Delta)$]
    We denote $\mathcal{G}(r,s,\Delta)$ to be the family of all $r$-graphs $G$ with $s$ edges and maximum degree $\Delta(G)\le\Delta$. $\mathcal{G}'(r,s,\Delta)$ is the set of all $r$-partite graphs in $\mathcal{G}(r,s,\Delta)$.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[$H$-free]
    We say that a graph $G$ is $H$-free if it does not contain a copy of $H$. 
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[expanded hypergraph]
    Given an $r$-graph $G$ and $k \ge r$, the $k$-expansion $G^+=G^+(k)$ is the $k$-uniform hypergraph obtained from $G$ by adding $k-r$ distinct new vertices to each edge.\footnote{Unless stated otherwise it is assumed that wherever we see $G^+$ we mean $G^+(k)$.}
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[cross containment]
Let $\mathcal{H}_1,\ldots,\mathcal{H}_s\subseteq \{0,1\}^V$. We say that $\mathcal{F}_1,\ldots,\mathcal{F}_s \subseteq \{0,1\}^X$ cross contain  $\mathcal{H}_1,\ldots,\mathcal{H}_s$ if there is an injection $\phi:V \rightarrow X$ such that $\phi(\mathcal{H}_i) \subseteq \mathcal{F}_i$ for all $i \in [s]$. We write $\phi(\mathcal{H}_i)=\{\phi(e):e\in\mathcal{H}_i\}$ with $\phi(e)=\{\phi(x):x\in e\}$. We say $\mathcal{F}$ contains $\mathcal{H}$ if $\mathcal{F}_1\ldots\mathcal{F}_s$ cross contain any ordering of the edges of $\mathcal{H}$.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[crosscut number]
    The crosscut number of an $r$-graph $G$, denoted by $\sigma(G)$, is the minimum value of $|S|$ where $S\subseteq V(G^+)$ and $|E \cap S|=1$ for all $E \in G^+$.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[transversal number]
    The transversal number of an $r$-graph $G$, denoted by $\tau(G)$, is the minimum value of $|S|$ where $|S \cap e|\ge 1$ for all $e \in E(G)$.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[generalised star]
We define the generalised star $\mathcal{S}_{n,k,S}$ by,
  \[\mathcal{S}_{n,k,S}=\{A \in \binom{[n]}{k}:A\cap S \neq \emptyset\}.\]
  In the case where $S$ is replaced by a set $S=[s]$ we may write
   \[\mathcal{S}_{n,k,s}=\{A \in \binom{[n]}{k}:A\cap [s] \neq \emptyset\}.\]
    
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[matching]
A family $\mathcal{F}$ contains an $s$-matching if there exists a set $\{A_1,\ldots A_s\} \subseteq \mathcal{F}$ with $A_i \cap A_j = \emptyset$ for all distinct $i,j$ in $[s]$.


\end{definition}

\section{Proof of Theorem \ref{KLLM Junta approx}}

We will now present the proof of Theorem \ref{KLLM Junta approx}. In order to do so we need the following two lemmas concerning embedding results in which proving will make up the bulk of the rest of this chapter:

\begin{lemma}[\cite{keevash2024turan}, Lemma 2.9]\label{lemma 2.9 KLLM}
Given $G \in \mathcal{G}(r,s,\Delta)$, $C \gg r\Delta$ and $C \le k_i \le n/Cs$ for all $i \in [s]$, any $\mathcal{F}_i \subseteq \binom{[n]}{k_i}$ with all $\mu(\mathcal{F}_i) \ge e^{-k_i/C}+Csk_i/n$ cross contain $G^+$.
    
\end{lemma}

\begin{lemma}[\cite{keevash2024turan}, Lemma 2.10]\label{lemma 2.10 KLLM}Given $G \in \mathcal{G}(r,s,\Delta)$, $C \gg C_1 \gg C_2 \gg r\Delta$ and $C \le k \le n/Cs$, and $(C_1s, sk/C_2n)$-uncapturable $\mathcal{F} \subseteq \binom{[n]}{k}$ contains $G^+$.
    
\end{lemma}

We now present the proof of Theorem \ref{KLLM Junta approx}:

\begin{proof}[Proof of Theorem \ref{KLLM Junta approx}]

Let $G \in \mathcal{G}(r,s,\Delta)$ and $C \gg C_1 \gg C_2 \gg r\Delta\epsilon^{-1}$. Consider any $G^+$-free $\mathcal{F}\subseteq\binom{[n]}{k}$ with $C \le k \le n/Cs$. We will show that for $\beta = e^{-k/C_1}+C_1sk/n$, the set $J = \{i \in [n]:\mu(\mathcal{F}_i^i)\ge \beta\}$ satisfies the required conditions set out in Theorem \ref{KLLM Junta approx}.\\
First of assume that $|J| \ge \sigma(G)$. Then we are able to fix a minimal crosscut $S \subseteq V(G^+)$ where there exists an injection $\phi:S \rightarrow J$. Hence we are able to impose distinct $j_s \in J$ for all $s \in S$. Let $I = \{i \in [n]: i = j_s \text{ for some } s\in S\}$, the range of $\phi$, and $\mathcal{F}_s=\mathcal{F}_{I}^{j_s}$ for $s \in S$. It follows from the definition of $J$ that for each $s \in S$ we have the lower bound $\mu(\mathcal{F}_s)>\beta - |I|k/n>\beta/2$. Hence by Lemma \ref{lemma 2.9 KLLM} the families composing the set $\{\mathcal{F}_s:s\in S\}$ cross contain the families composing the set $\{(G^+)_s^s\}$, but this would contradict $\mathcal{F}$ being $G^+$-free.

To show that $|\mathcal{F} \backslash \mathcal{S}_{n,k,J}| \le \epsilon|\mathcal{S}_{n,k,\sigma(G)-1}|$ we need the following lemma:

\begin{lemma}[\cite{keevash2024turan}, Lemma 2.8]\label{lemma 2.8 of KLLM}
    Let $\mathcal{F} \subseteq \binom{[n]}{k}$ and $J = \{i:\mu(\mathcal{F}_i^i)> \epsilon\}$. If $|J|<n/2k$ then $\mathcal{G}=\mathcal{F}_J^{\emptyset}$ is $(1,2\epsilon)$-global, and so $(a,\mu(\mathcal{G})/2)$-uncapturable with $a=\mu(\mathcal{G})n/4k\epsilon$. 
\end{lemma}
Since $|J|<s\le n/Ck$, applying Lemma \ref{lemma 2.8 of KLLM} implies that $\mathcal{G}=\mathcal{F}_J^{\emptyset}$ is $(a,\mu(\mathcal{G})/2)$-uncapturable with $a=\mu(\mathcal{G})n/4k\beta$. On the other hand, taking the contrapositive, Lemma \ref{lemma 2.10 KLLM} tells us that $\mathcal{G}$ is $(C_1s,sk/C_2n)$-capturable, hence it is clear from the definition of uncapturability that $a < C_1s$ and/or $\mu(\mathcal{G})/2 < sk/C_2n$. It follows that $\mu(\mathcal{G})<4\beta C_1sk/n<sk/C_2n$. Since $\mu(\mathcal{S}_{n,k,\sigma(G)-1})>0.9(\sigma(G)-1)k/n$ as well as $s \le \Delta \sigma(G)$ we have that $|\mathcal{F}\backslash\mathcal{S}_{n,k,J}| = |\mathcal{G}|\le\epsilon|\mathcal{S}_{n,k,\sigma(G)-1}|$.


    
\end{proof}

\subsection{Proof of Lemma \ref{lemma 2.9 KLLM}}
We now prove Lemma \ref{lemma 2.9 KLLM}, closely following \cite{keevash2024turan}. We first begin with the following lemma of Huang, Loh, and Sudakov:
\begin{lemma}[\cite{huang2012size}, Lemma 3.1]\label{HLS lemma 3.1}
    Let $\mathcal{F}_1, \ldots \mathcal{F}_t$ be families of subsets of $[n]$ such that for each $i$, $\mathcal{F}_i$ is $k_i$-uniform, $|\mathcal{F}_i|>(t-1)\binom{n-1}{k_i-1}$, and $n\ge \sum_{i=1}^tk_i$. Then there exist $t$ pairwise disjoint sets $F_1 \in \mathcal{F}_1\ldots F_t \in \mathcal{F}_t$.
\end{lemma}
We will need the contrapositive of this when proving Lemma \ref{lemma 2.9 KLLM} so it will be useful to have in the following form. Corollary \ref{corollary of HLS} follows immediately from Lemma \ref{HLS lemma 3.1}:

\begin{corollary}\label{corollary of HLS}
    Let $k_1, \ldots k_s$, $n \in \mathbb{N}$ with $\sum_{i\in[s]}k_i \le n$. Suppose $\mathcal{F}_i \subseteq \binom{[n]}{k_i}$ for $i \in [s]$ do not cross contain a matching. Then $\mu(\mathcal{F}_i) \le k_i(s-1)/n$ for some $i \in [s]$.
\end{corollary}
We also need the following Fairness Proposition of Keller and Lifshitz:

\begin{proposition}[\cite{keller2017junta}, Fairness Proposition]
Let $C \gg r/\epsilon$ and $\mathcal{F}\subseteq \binom{[n]}{k}$ with $k \ge r$ and $\mu(\mathcal{F}) \ge e^{-k/C}.$ Then for $c=(1-\epsilon)\mu(\mathcal{F})$ we have that \[\mu(\partial_c^r\mathcal{F}) \ge 1-\epsilon,\] where $\partial_c^r\mathcal{F} = \{A \in \binom{[n]}{r}:\mu(\mathcal{F}_A^A) \ge c\}$ is called the $c$-fat $r$-shadow of $\mathcal{F}$.
\end{proposition}
Finally we need the following cross embedding result:

\begin{lemma}[\cite{keevash2024turan}, Lemma 4.9]\label{lemma 4.9 KLLM TURAN}
Let $0 < \eta \ll (r\Delta)^{-1}$ and $G=\{e_1,\ldots,e_s\}$ be a hypergraph of maximum degree $\Delta$ with each $|e_i|=r_i \le r$. Suppose for each $i\in[s]$ that $\mathcal{G}_i$ is an $r_i$-graph on $[n]$, where $n \ge 2rs$ and $\mu(\mathcal{G}_i)>1-\eta$. Then $\mathcal{G}_1,\ldots \mathcal{G}_s$ cross contain $G$.
\end{lemma}
With these we are able to prove Lemma \ref{lemma 2.9 KLLM}
\begin{proof}[Proof of Lemma \ref{lemma 2.9 KLLM}]
Suppose $n,s,k_1,\ldots k_s \in \mathbb{N}$ satisfy $C\le k_i \le n/Cs$ for all $i \in [s]$,and $\mathcal{F}_i \subseteq \binom{[n]}{k_i}$ be such that $\mu(\mathcal{F}_i)\ge e^{-k_i/C}+Csk_i/n$. Let $\eta$ be as is in Lemma \ref{lemma 4.9 KLLM TURAN}. For each $i \in [s]$ we let $\mathcal{G}_i = \partial_{Csk_i/2n}^r\mathcal{F}_i$. Then by the Fairness Proposition, we may take $C$ large enough such that for all $i \in [s]$, $\mu(\mathcal{G}_i) \ge 1-\eta$. Letting $G$ be the graph described in Lemma \ref{lemma 4.9 KLLM TURAN}, we have that there exist $R_1,\ldots R_s$ that form a copy of $G$, where for $i \in [s]$ we have $R_i \in \mathcal{G}_i$. Denoting $R=R_1 \cup \ldots \cup R_s$ we have, by the union bound, that for all $i \in [s]$ and $C\ge8$,\[\mu((\mathcal{F}_i)_{R}^{R_i}) \ge \mu((\mathcal{F}_i)_{R_i}^{R_i})-|R|k_i/n \ge Csk_i/4n. \]By the lower bound on $C$ we have $\sum_{i \in [s]}k_i \le n/C \le n$, hence by the contrapositive of Corollary \ref{corollary of HLS}, there exists a cross matching $E_1, \ldots, E_s$ in $(\mathcal{F}_1)_R^{R_1}, \ldots, (\mathcal{F}_s)_R^{R_s}$. It follows then that $\mathcal{F}_1,\ldots,\mathcal{F}_s$ cross contain a copy of $G^+$ with edges $R_1 \cup E_1,\ldots, R_s\cup E_s$.
\end{proof}

\subsection{Proof of Lemma \ref{lemma 2.10 KLLM}}
We will need more results in order to prove Lemma \ref{lemma 2.10 KLLM}. It is this result which is a far reaching application of the KLLM hypercontractive inequality which will be briefly explained at the end of the chapter. We need the following results:

\begin{lemma}[\cite{keevash2024turan}, Lemma 2.2]\label{lemma 2.2 KLLM}
    If $\mathcal{F}\subseteq \binom{[n]}{k}$ is $(a,\epsilon)$-global and $I \subseteq J \subseteq [n]$ with $|I|>a$ and $|J|<n/2k$ then $\mathcal{F}_J^I$ is $(a-|I|,2\epsilon)$-global.
\end{lemma}
\begin{lemma}[\cite{keevash2024turan}, Lemma 2.4]\label{lemma 2.4 KLLM}
    If $\mathcal{F} \subseteq \binom{[n]}{k}$ is $(1,\epsilon)$-global with $\epsilon=\mu(\mathcal{F})n/2ak$ then $\mathcal{F}$ is $(a,\mu(\mathcal{F})/2)$-uncapturable.
\end{lemma}

\begin{lemma}[\cite{keevash2024turan}, Lemma 3.1]\label{lemma 3.1 KLLM}
Let $C \gg C_1 \gg C_2 \gg 1$ and $\mathcal{F}_i \subseteq \binom{[n]}{k_i}$ with $k_i \le n/Cs$ for $i \in [s]$. Suppose $\mathcal{F}_i$ is $(C_1m,mk_i/C_2n)$-uncapturable for $i \in [m]$ and $\mu(\mathcal{F}_i)>C_1sk_i/n$ for $i>m$. Then $\mathcal{F}_1,\ldots \mathcal{F}_s$ cross contain a matching.
    
\end{lemma}
\begin{lemma}[\cite{keevash2024turan}, Lemma 4.4]\label{lemma 4.4 KLLM}
Let $\mathcal{F} \subseteq \binom{[n]}{k}$, $r<l<k$ and $\mathcal{H}=\{D \in \binom{[n]}{l}:\partial^rD \subseteq \partial_c^r\mathcal{F}\}$, where $c=\mu(\mathcal{F})/2\binom{l}{r}$. Then $\mu(\mathcal{H}) \ge \mu(\mathcal{F})/2$. Thus $\mu(\partial_c^r\mathcal{F}) \ge (\mu(\mathcal{F})/2)^{r/l}$. Furthermore, if $G\in \mathcal{G}'(r,s,\Delta)$, $C \gg r\Delta$ and $\partial_c^r$ is $G$-free then we have the following inequality: \[\mu(\partial_c^r\mathcal{F}) \ge ((\mu(\mathcal{F})/2-(s/n)^{l/C})n/sl^2)^{r/(l-1)}.\]
    
\end{lemma}

\begin{lemma}[\cite{keevash2024turan}, Lemma 4.7]\label{lemma 4.7 KLLM}
Let $G\in\mathcal{G}'(r,s,\Delta)$, $C \gg r\Delta$, $C \le k \le n/Cs$ and $\mathcal{F}\subseteq \binom{[n]}{k}$. If $\partial^r\mathcal{F}$ is $G$-free then $\mu(\mathcal{F}) \le (s/n)^{k/C}$.   
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}[Proof of Lemma \ref{lemma 2.10 KLLM}]Let $G \in \mathcal{G}(r,s,\Delta)$ and $C \gg C_1 \gg C_2 \gg r\Delta$. Suppose for a contradiction that there exists $\mathcal{F}\subseteq\binom{[n]}{k}$ with $C \le k \le n/Cs$ is $(C_1s,sk/C_2n)$-uncapturable and $G^+$-free. Let $\mathcal{D}$ be a maximal set of pairwise disjoint sets such that for each $D \in \mathcal{D}$ we have that \begin{enumerate}
    \item $|D|\le r+1$.
    \item $\mu(\mathcal{F}_D^D)>\beta=e^{-k/C_1}+C_1sk/n$.
\end{enumerate}
We will show that $|\mathcal{D}|<s$. Suppose for a contradiction, then there exist distinct $D_1,\ldots D_s \in \mathcal{D}$. Let $D^* = \bigcup_{i \in [s]} D_s$ and $\mathcal{F}_i=\mathcal{F}_{D^*}^{D_i}$ for $i \in [s]$. Then we have for each $i \in [s]$, \[\mu(\mathcal{F}_i)>\beta - |D^*|k/n = e^{-k/C_1}+(C_1s-|D^*|)k/n > e^{-k/C_1}+C_1sk/2n.\]By Lemma \ref{lemma 2.9 KLLM}, there exists a cross copy of $G^+$ in $F_1\ldots,F_s$, but $\mathcal{F}$ is $G^+$-free, hence by contradiction $|\mathcal{D}|<s$.\\
Let $D^{\dagger}=\bigcup\mathcal{D}$, and consider $\mathcal{G}=\mathcal{F}_{D^{\dagger}}^{\emptyset}$. By definition of the uncapturability of $\mathcal{F}$, we have $\mu(\mathcal{G})>sk/C_2n$ and by the definition of $D^{\dagger}$ we have that $\mathcal{G}$ is $(r+1,2\beta)$-global. Let $\mathcal{H}=\{E \in \binom{[n]}{C_2}:\partial^rE\subseteq \partial_c^r\mathcal{G}\}$, with $c = \mu(\mathcal{G})/2\binom{C_2}{r}>sk/n(C_2)^{2r}$. Then $\mu(\mathcal{H})\ge \mu(\mathcal{G})/2$ by Lemma \ref{lemma 4.4 KLLM}. Suppose $\partial^r\mathcal{H}$ is not $G$-free, then there is $A_1,\ldots,A_s$ that form a copy of $G$ in $\partial^r\mathcal{H}$. Let $A = \bigcup_{i=1}^sA_i$ and $\mathcal{G}_i=\mathcal{G}_A^{A_i}$. Lemma \ref{lemma 2.2 KLLM} implies that $\mathcal{G}_i$ is $(1,4\beta)$-global where $\mu(\mathcal{G}_i)>c-2|A|\beta k/n >c/2$. Hence by Lemma \ref{lemma 2.4 KLLM} for each $i \in [s]$, we have that $\mathcal{G}_i$ is $(C_1s,c/4)$-uncapturable, so by Lemma \ref{lemma 3.1 KLLM} $\mathcal{G}_1,\ldots,\mathcal{G}_s$ cross contain a matching with $m=s$, contradicting $\mathcal{F}$ being $G$-free. Hence $\partial^r\mathcal{H}$ is indeed $G$-free and so by Lemma \ref{lemma 4.7 KLLM}, replacing $C$ with $C_2/2 \gg r\Delta$ gives the final desired contradiction: \[skC_2/n < \mu(\mathcal{G}) \le 2\mu(\mathcal{H}) \le (s/n)^2,\]
verifying Lemma \ref{lemma 2.10 KLLM}.
    
\end{proof}
\section{Commentary on the use of global hypercontractivity and Turán results following the junta approximation}
In the previous section we gave a partial proof of Keevash, Lifshitz, Long, and Minzer's asymptotic junta approximation. In this final section we will briefly outline where exactly hypercontractivity was used to obtain this result, as well as listing three previously long unsolved problems which were proven in \cite{keevash2024turan} using their new machinery. 


\subsection{The application of global hypercontractivity in proving the critical result concerning cross containment of matchings in uncapturable families, Lemma \ref{lemma 3.1 KLLM}}In the proof of Lemma \ref{lemma 2.10 KLLM}, we required the unproven Lemma \ref{lemma 3.1 KLLM}, which concerns cross containment of matchings in uncapturable families. As the focus of this dissertation is on the applications, and not the underlying theory, of hypercontractivty we will omit the proof of this critical lemma, but the idea of the proof, as Keevash, Lifshitz, Long and Minzer state \cite{keevash2024turan},\begin{center}
     ``... is to take suitable restrictions that boost the measure of the
families so that we can apply the extremal result from the previous subsection. However, uncapturability is not preserved by restrictions, so we first upgrade to globalness, which is preserved by restrictions.
We also pass from the setting of uniform families to that of biased measures, which allows us to apply
our sharp threshold result,...'' (p.11).
\end{center}
In particular the proof invokes the use of the unstated Theorem 3.5.1 from \cite{keevash2024turan}, which is a direct consequence of the critical sharp threshold result, Theorem \ref{KLLM sharp threshold}, referenced at in the above quote. This in turn is a consequence of the initial KLLM hypercontractivity result, Theorem \ref{KLLM hypercontractivity}, of which their link can be found in \cite{keevash2024hypercontractivity}.
\subsection{KLLM's refined junta approximation, exact Turán results and generalised criticality}

Although Theorem \ref{KLLM Junta approx} is sufficient for proving asymptotic Turán results, in order to get exact results one needs Keevash, Lifshitz, Long, and Minzer's refined junta approximation which we will state, without proof, for completeness:

\begin{theorem}[\cite{keevash2024turan}, Theorem 1.9]\label{refined KLLM junta approx}
Let $G \in \mathcal{G}(r,s,\Delta)$, $0 <C^{-1}\ll \delta \ll \epsilon \ll (r\Delta)^{-1}$ and $C \le k \le n/Cs$. Then for any $G^+$-free $\mathcal{F} \subseteq \binom{[n]}{k}$ with $|\mathcal{F}|>|\mathcal{S}_{n,k,\sigma(G)-1}|-\delta\binom{n-1}{k-1}$ there is $J\in \binom{[n]}{\sigma(G)-1}$ with $|\mathcal{F}\backslash\mathcal{S}_{n,k,J}|\le \epsilon \binom{n-1}{k-1}$.    
\end{theorem}

The refined junta approximation, which improves upon the bound for $|\mathcal{F}\backslash \mathcal{S}_{n,k,J}|$, is used in \cite{keevash2024turan} to prove two exact Turán results. Before stating them we need the following definition:

\begin{definition}[criticality and generalised criticality]
For an $r$-graph $G$ we say that $G$ is critical if it has an edge $e$ such that $\sigma(G \backslash e)=\tau(G \backslash e) <\tau(G)=\sigma(G)$.\\
For any graph $G$ such that $\sigma(G)=\tau(G)$ we say that: \begin{enumerate}
    \item $G$ is $a_1$-degree-critical if (i) there exists a vertex $x$ such that $|G_x^x|\le a_1 $ and $\sigma(G-x)<\sigma(G)$ and (ii) for all vertices $x$ such that $|G_x^x| < a_1$ we have that $\tau(G-x)=\tau(G)$.
    \item $G$ is $a_2$-matching-critical if (i) there exists a matching $M$ such that $|M|\le a_2$ and $\sigma(G\backslash M)<\sigma(G)$ and (ii) for all matchings $M$ such that $|M|<a_2$ we have that $\tau(G \backslash M)=\tau(G)$.
\end{enumerate}
We say that $G$ is $(a_1,a_2)$-critical if it is both $a_1$-degree-critical and $a_2$-degree-matching critical.
    
\end{definition}
The two exact Turán results proven in \cite{keevash2024turan} are as follows. First we have a Turán result concerning expanded critical $r$-graphs of bounded degree:

\begin{theorem}[\cite{keevash2024turan}, Theorem 7.1]
    Let $G\in\mathcal{G}(r,s,\Delta)$ be critical and $C \gg \beta^{-1} \gg dr\Delta$. Suppose $\mathcal{F}\subseteq \binom{[n]}{k}$ with $C \le k \le n/Cs$ is $G^+$-free and $|\mathcal{F}|\ge|\mathcal{S}_{n,k,\sigma-1}|-\epsilon\binom{n-1}{k-1}$ with $\epsilon\in(0,\beta)$.\\ Then there exists $J \in \binom{[n]}{\sigma-1}$ with $|\mathcal{F}\backslash\mathcal{S}_{n,k,J}|\le \epsilon^d\binom{n-1}{k-1}$. \\Furthermore, if $k \le \sqrt{n}$ and $|\mathcal{F}|\ge|\mathcal{S}_{n,k,J}|-\beta\binom{n-r}{k-r}$ then $\mathcal{F}\subseteq \mathcal{S}_{n,k,J}$.
\end{theorem}

The second Turán result concerns extended paths. It is a strong stability result concerning the Füredi–Jiang–Seiver conjecture \cite{furedi2014exact}. We say $\mathcal{F}_{n,k,G} = \{A \in \binom{[n]}{k}:\mathcal{T}\subseteq A\}$ is the $k$-uniform hypergraph generated by $\mathcal{T}$ on ground set $[n]$, where in particular $\mathcal{T}$ is the disjoint union of $\sigma(G)-1$ singletons and a graph $F_{a_1,a_2}$ with maximal edges subject to $\Delta(F_{a_1,a_2})\le a_1-1$ and no matching of size $\ge a_2$. By definition of generalised criticality, $\mathcal{F}_{n,k,G}$ is $G^+$-free. The following theorem states that it is extremal:



\begin{theorem}[\cite{keevash2024turan}, Theorem 8.2] 
    Let $G\in \mathcal{G}(2,s,\Delta)$ be $(a_1,a_2)$-critical, $\sigma = \sigma(G)$ and $C \gg \beta^{-1} \gg a_2d\Delta$. Suppose $\mathcal{F} \subseteq \binom{[n]}{k}$ with $C \le k \le n/Cs$ is $G^+$-free.\\ If $|\mathcal{F}| \ge |\mathcal{S}_{n,k,\sigma-1}|$ then $|\mathcal{F}\backslash \mathcal{G}_{n,k}(\mathcal{T})| \le \beta^{-1}\binom{n-3}{k-3}$ for some $\mathcal{T}=\{\{x\}:x\in J\}\cup F$ where $J \in \binom{[n]}{\sigma-1}$ and $F \subseteq \binom{[n]\backslash J}{2}$ with $|F|\le|F_{a_1,a_2}|$.\\
    Moreover if $|\mathcal{F}| \ge |\mathcal{F}_{n,k,G}|-\epsilon\binom{n-2}{k-2}$ with $\epsilon \in (0,\beta)$ then $\mu(\mathcal{F}\backslash \mathcal{G}) \le (\epsilon k/n)^d$ for some copy $\mathcal{G}$ of $\mathcal{F}_{n,k,G}$, where if $k \le \sqrt{n}$ then $\mathcal{F}\subseteq \mathcal{G}$.
    
\end{theorem}
We will not prove these two theorems but both are, as previously mentioned, reliant on the refined junta approximation, Theorem \ref{refined KLLM junta approx}. The reason we state these however, outside of being interesting in their own right, is in regards to a point made by the authors at the end of their original paper and by Keevash directly. The refined junta approximation result, a far reaching application of the novel global hypercontractivity, is applicable seemingly only under the highly restrictive notion of generalised criticality. The two Turán results stated were the only two examples the authors were able to apply their junta result to, and so it would be interesting going forward to try and find new examples, something we spent alot of time on and were unfortunately unable to do. 
%\chapter{Definitions of Keevash paper}
%In [Reference applications of global hypercontractivity] it is demonstrated that global hypercontractivity allows for the proving of stability results in numerous unsolved cases via junta-like methods, including the former Huang-Loh-Sudakov and F\"{u}redi-Jiang-Siever conjectures and a Turán result on critical expanded $r$-graphs of bounded degree. The authors note that in order to apply global-hypercontractivity in this fashion, the setup must respect a restrictive condition known as generalised criticality. Recall the crosscut number of an $r$-graph G, denoted by $\sigma(G)$, is the minimum value of $|S|$ where $S\subseteq V(G^+)$ and $|E \cap S|=1$ for all $E \in G^+$, and that the transversal number of a graph $G$, denoted $\tau(G)$, is the minimum cardinality of a subset of $[n]$ which intersects all edges $E\in E(G)$. It is noted in https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.04604 that $\sigma(G) \ge \tau(G)$. We define generalised criticality as follows.
%\begin{definition}[Generalised criticality]
%Consider any $G$ with $\sigma(G)=\tau(G)$. Then $G$ is $a_1$-degree-critical if: %\begin{enumerate}
   % \item $\sigma(G-x)<\sigma(G)$ for some $x$ of degree $|G_x^x|\le a_1$,
 %   \item $\tau(G-x) = \tau(G) $ for any $x$ of degree $|G_x^x| < a_1$.
%\end{enumerate}
%$G$ is $a_2$-matching-critical if:\begin{enumerate}
   % \item $\sigma(G\backslash M)<\sigma(G)$ for some matching $M$ with $|M|\le a_2$,
  %  \item $\tau(G\backslash M)=\tau(G)$ for any matching $M$ with $|M|<a_2$.
%\end{enumerate} 
%We say $G$ is $(a_1,a_2)$-critical if it is both $a_1$-degree-critical and $a_2$-matching-critical.\end{definition}
%\begin{definition}
   % $\mathcal{G}(r,s,\Delta)$ denotes the set-system of all $r$-graphs $G$ with $s$ edges and maximum degree $\Delta(G)\le \Delta$. $\mathcal{G}'(r,s,\Delta)$ denotes the set system of all $r$-partite, $r$-graphs $G$ with $s$ edges and maximum degree $\Delta(G) \le \Delta$.
%\end{definition}
%\begin{definition}[Critical graph]
%An $r$-graph $G$ is \textit{critical} if it has an edge $e$ such that $\sigma(G\backslash e)=\tau(G \backslash e) < \tau(G) = \sigma(G)$.    
%\end{definition}
%\subsection{Expanded hypergraphs}
%Given an $r$-graph $G$ and $k \ge r$, the $k$-expansion $G^+=G^+(k)$ is th $k$-uniform hypergraph obtained from $G$ by adding $k-r$ new vertices to each edge. In particular a $k$-graph $s$-matching is the $k$-expansion of a graph $s$-matching.
%\subsection{Notation}
%\begin{definition}[Star]
 %   $\mathcal{S}_{n,k,s-1}=\{A \in \binom{[n]}{k}:A\cap [s-1] \neq \emptyset\}$
%\end{definition}
%\begin{definition}[Clique]
 %   $\mathcal{C}_{k,s-1}=\binom{[ks-1]}{k}$
%\end{definition}
%\begin{definition}[Little o notation]
 %   $a \ll b$ means $a=o(b)$ which means $a(n)/b(n) \rightarrow 0$ as $n \rightarrow \infty$.
%\end{definition}
%\begin{definition}[Cross containment]
%Let $\mathcal{H}_1,\ldots,\mathcal{H}_s\subseteq \{0,1\}^V$. We say that $\mathcal{F}_1,\ldots,\mathcal{F}_s \subseteq \{0,1\}^X$ cross contain  $\mathcal{H}_1,\ldots,\mathcal{H}_s$ if there is an injection $\phi:V \rightarrow X$ such that $\phi(\mathcal{H}_i) \subseteq \mathcal{F}_i$ for all $i \in [s]$. We write $\phi(\mathcal{H}_i)=\{\phi(e):e\in\mathcal{H}_i\}$ with $\phi(e)=\{\phi(x):x\in e\}$.
%\end{definition}
%\begin{definition}[$\mathcal{F}^B_J$]For $\mathcal{F}\subseteq \{0,1\}^X$ and $B \subseteq J \subseteq X$ we write $\mathcal{F}^B_J$ for the family \[\mathcal{F}^B_J=\{A \in \{0,1\}^{X\backslash J} : A \cup B \in \mathcal{F}\} \subseteq \{0,1\}^{X \backslash J}\]
    %\end{definition}



\chapter{Conclusion}
We have provided an overview of utilising the junta method to prove stability results in extremal combinatorics, an application of hypercontractivity. We have seen both applications of the somewhat classical local hypercontractivity results in proving Theorem \ref{Friedgut Main} to give a stability result concerning the maximal measure of intersecting sets (Corollary \ref{Friedgut stability theorem}), and a result of Kindler and Safra (Theorem \ref{Kindler badboy}), reliant on local hypercontractivity, to give a stability result concerning the maximal measure of a triangle-intersecting family of graphs (Corollary \ref{corollary of ellis}, Stability). \\
In chapter 4, in order to prove the stability result, we needed to show that the Fourier expansion of the characteristic functions of the maximal-measure intersecting families were concentrated on the first two levels, allowing us to directly apply Theorem \ref{Friedgut Main}.\\ 
In chapter 5, the crucial link between a triangle-intersecting family $\mathcal{F}$ and its respective characteristic functions was that described in Claim \ref{Bipartite graph observation}, concerning the symmetric difference of elements $A \in \mathcal{F}$ with any bipartite graph $B$. Following the proof in \cite{ellis2012triangle}, whilst independently verifying the unproven claims \ref{Bipartite graph observation}, \ref{claim 2}, and \ref{claim 3} we were able to prove the auxiliary Theorem \ref{Ellis main theorem} and its corollary, which when combined with the ability to alternate between odd cycle-agreeing and odd-cycle-intersecting, and the existence of an appropriate OCC spectrum $\Delta$ (see \cite{ellis2012triangle}, sections 2.3 and 2.4 respectively) proves Theorem \ref{ELLIS TRIANGLE JUNTA THEOREM} for the case $p=1/2$. We note the stark differences in the approaches used in chapters 4 and 5, a direct consequence of the change of the structure of the corresponding ground sets, $[n]$ and $\binom{[n]}{2}$ respectively.\\
In chapter 6 we provided a brief overview of the novel KLLM junta approximation result, a far reaching application of their global hypercontractivity inequality. We identified the critical lemma where this is used (\cite{keevash2024turan}, Lemma 3.1) and direct the reader here for the exact details of how the KLLM hypercontractive inequality is utilised. (They may also need to look at \cite{keevash2024hypercontractivity}, where the sharp threshold result Theorem \ref{KLLM sharp threshold} is initially proven.) Finally we stated without proof two Turán results proven in \cite{keevash2024turan} utilising the refined KLLM junta approximation, and noted that only under the highly restrictive condition of generalised criticality was it able to be applied.
 \newpage



%We note that in these two cases, although both concerned intersecting families, in changing the structure of the ground set (from $[n]$ to $\binom{[n]}{2}$) the spectral techniques necessary changed dramatically.
